State questions clearly in the title; both socialists and non-socialists may ask questions. Questions can be expanded upon in the text portion of the thread. Questions may be targeted toward a specific group, such as Anarchists, Marxist-Leninists, Mutualists, etc. But unless otherwise stated, your questions are assumed to be directed toward all socialists.\nR2. Don\u2019t Soapbox \u2014 You may expand upon your question, and ask follow-up questions in response to any answer you receive, but don\u2019t use the forum as a platform to spread anti-communism. Similarly, polemic or trolling questions meant to start antagonistic arguments, provoke, or escalate disagreements to the level of insults will not be tolerated.\nR3. Don\u2019t ask Loaded/Leading Questions \u2014 Don\u2019t front-load a question with baseless assertions. We understand that knowledge is primarily made-up of background assumptions and preconceived notions that are part-and-parcel of Liberal ideology. Check those at the door, and don\u2019t include them as part of your question unless your question cannot be addressed without them. (Bad Question: \u201cIt\u2019s been proven that socialism doesn\u2019t work, why do you support it?\u201d \u2013 Good Question: \u201cWhat lead you to support socialism?\u201d)\nR4. Be confident when asking your question. There\u2019s no such thing as a silly question, so don\u2019t self-deprecate in your own thread by calling yourself, or your question, foolish.\nR5. Non-socialists may piggy-back on pre-existing threads to ask follow-up questions. Don't derail pre-existing threads with non-sequiturs."}, {"header": "Rules for Answers", "description": "R1. If you\u2019re not a socialist, don\u2019t answer questions. Non-socialist answers will be removed, and repeated offenses lead to banning. People come to Socialism_101 looking for answers from socialists, not capitalists.\nR2. Refrain from making spurious or unverifiable claims. When answering questions, keep in mind that you may be asked to cite your sources. This is a learning subreddit, meaning you must be prepared to provide evidence, scientific or historical, to back up your claims. Link to appropriate sources when/if possible. An answer isn't good because it's right, it's good because it teaches.\nR3. Refrain from engaging in sectarian behaviour such as strawmaning, misrepresenting, or slandering rival factions/tendencies. Snide jabs at Anarchists if you\u2019re a Marxist, or at Marxists if you\u2019re an Anarchist, are not only contrary to the spirit of the sub, but counter-productive for the purpose of teaching.

If you're using a sign, crumple the paper then unfold. There will be a two-step verification for any pictures that do not pass processing.\nSubreddit Rules:\nDo not post your username or group hashtag in your post or comment. Do not hint at what it might be. We absolutely do not allow any information like that in public for safety reasons. There is no middle ground here, you must instruct users to PM you. Here is why\nWe are a judgement free zone: we ask users to keep comments positive. This isn't the place to oppress others with your morals. If you think a post is not appropriate, use the report button.\nSelling of services is absolutely prohibited here. Use the report button or modmail if you come across a seller; there are subreddits better suited for this kind of thing. Users are here for free hugs!\nEveryone is welcome to post once every twelve hours. Removing old posts or using alternate usernames does not exempt you from this rule.\nUsers will not post on behalf of others. Don't post pictures of others either. This is super catfishy and creepy.\nDon't message the OP if you don't fit their criteria: There are plenty of other fish in the sea.\nBe ready to chat now: Don't expect to post, go to sleep or take a flight and then come back later to a full inbox. This is pretty selfish tbh and your post will be removed.\nGroups: you too may post once every twelve hours and make sure other group users don't post within twelve hours of your post. Take care to ensure that your post isn't voted on by your users as this is considered to be vote manipulation. Your users are welcome and encouraged to comment though!\nHow to create a post:\nWhen creating a post you are required to use the proper tags or the AutoModerator will automatically remove it.\nThe title should start off with your age and then the proper tag, you can pick from those listed below\nM Stands for Male. F stands for Female. R stands for Redditor (meaning any gender or unspecified) and T stands for Trans. Tag Examples: 22 [F4M], [M4F], [G4F], [M4M], [T4F], [T4M], [M4G], [F4R], [T4R].\nYou can add something constructive after the gender tag.
