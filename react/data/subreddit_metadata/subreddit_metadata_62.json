Also keep in mind that laptops are assembled much faster than desktops, so make sure the other person isn't talking about a laptop.\nMy order has been at X step for Y days, is this normal?\nDepends on the time of year and how backed up production is. standard build times have orders progressing through most steps within 2-3 business days.

This is a subreddit for the crypto coin called 'Corgi Inu' (CORGI).\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE\nhttps://corgiinu.com/\nJOIN TELEGRAM\nhttps://t.me/corgi_inu_token\nFOLLOW OUR TWITTER\nhttps://twitter.com/CorgiinuToken\nLive Price Chart and Trading History\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xd563809827023e5b1160b554b86fe47f50cf9c44\nHow to buy CORGI\nStep 1\nGo to Uniswap https://app.uniswap.org/ and connect your wallet to it. It can be coinbase wallet, trustwallet or metamask.\nStep 2\nSince CORGI is a very new coin and hasn't been listed on coingecko or coinmarketcap, it won't show up by default when you search for it. In order to buy or sell the coin, you have to type in the token address in the search bar.\nToken address: 0xe50006781f435ae43096288334afd9ae5ba50065\nThis is the token address taken from the Corgi Inu website. https://corgiinu.com/\nStep 3\nYou should now be able to see CORGI and in order to buy it, you need to use ETH. Make sure that you have enough ETH for gas fees. It varies depending on the time of the day and the amount of people using the ETH network. The price can vary from $15 up to $45. (On days with heavy traffic it can potentially reach $100-$200)\nSince the coin has a low market cap, the price will be fluctuating a lot. When people sell or buy, the value of CORGI might go up and down by 1-10%. In order to avoid any issues when buying CORGI, you'll need to click on the gear icon. Click on the icon and set your slippage to 5% or 10%. That if the price changes while your transaction is pending, the transaction won't get canceled. You won't have to pay for any extra gas fees, by trying to buy/sell it again.\nUniswap is also migrating to a newer version called V3. If it says that there's an error when trying to buy or sell the coin and that there's a liquidity issue. Try clicking on the small text where it says swap to V2 or V3, depending on which one you're on."}]}, "JustGuysBeingDudes": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:58:58.700558-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "No more ice-breaking posts and AI posts", "time_posted": "8 days ago"}, {"heading": "Who's a big boy?", "time_posted": "12 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Strong but not flexible", "time_posted": "18 hours ago"}, {"heading": "police at the park", "time_posted": "5 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Stay Nice", "Posts Must Include Guys", "Use Titles", "Flair Your Posts And Mark NSFW", "Don't repost", "Harmful / Rude to women", "Rage-bait / clickbait videos", "Have fun"], "subreddits": {"Friendly communities": {"r/WhyWomenLiveLonger": "579,816 members", "r/AskMenOver30": "442,918 members", "r/SweatyPalms": "2,113,138 members"}, "Fun <500k subs:": {"r/awfuleyebrows": "199,024 members", "r/instantbarbarians": "371,101 members", "r/bizarrelife": "354,151 members", "r/fixedbytheduet": "306,901 members", "r/SipsTea": "417,652 members", "r/meormyson": "60,238 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Raw footage of guys being dudes, boys being boys, or madlads just goofing around.", "created": "Created Sep 11, 2020", "stats": ["576k Guys", "548 Being Dudes right now"]}, "other_information": []}, "wholesome": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:59:11.265471-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Husband Surprises Wife With 50th Birthday Wish Over The Radio", "time_posted": "11 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Eduardo you are very good person", "time_posted": "5 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Lana Del Rey recognized some content creators whose videos she watches which totally caught them off guard", "time_posted": "8 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Be civil/Remember the human", "Must be Wholesome", "No Spam", "No Trolling/Baiting", "No Low Effort Posts", "No Reposts", "No Meta", "No Identifying Information", "No Solicitation"], "subreddits": {"Wholesome Subreddits": {"r/wholesomememes": "13,446,211 members", "r/wholesomegifs": "1,013,843 members", "r/WholesomeComics": "85,038 members", "r/CasualConversation": "2,103,058 members", "r/wholesomepics": "24,542 members", "r/Needafriend": "340,228 members", "r/HumansBeingBros": "4,826,463 members", "r/dogsbeingbros": "7,798 members", "r/explainlikeimfive": "22,069,192 members", "r/wholesomegreentext": "327,856 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "It\u2019s so wholesome in here :)", "created": "Created Nov 29, 2013", "stats": ["660k Members", "429 Online"]}, "other_information": []}}
