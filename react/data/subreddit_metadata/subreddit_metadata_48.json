Please do not hesitate to contact the mods if you are unsure of anything in this regard.\nDodgy legal theories\nPLEASE DO NOT post links or advocate the use of pseudo-legal theories known as \"Freeman on the land\" or its various Australian incarnations, and promoted by David Icke, Max Igan and the like. Such links or posts will be removed and the moderators may impose bans if the circumstances warrant it.
