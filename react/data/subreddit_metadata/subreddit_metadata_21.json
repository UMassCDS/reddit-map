David Kibbe is best known for his work as a stylist and image consultant in New York City. In 1987 he published his acclaimed book, Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle as Only You Can. In his book he discusses the 13 (now 10) Image Identities, based on the Old Hollywood Archetypes, and how one can embody these style archetypes through their clothing and essence. David\u2019s work differs from other styling systems that seek to \u201ccorrect\u201d one\u2019s body into a conventional hourglass. Instead, he seeks to harmonize with one\u2019s natural yin-yang balance by having their clothing imitate their natural shapes in their silhouette. The Kibbe system is about creating a style that is authentically you, embracing your natural features and enhancing them. \nThe Kibbe system is a tool to help people learn the importance of creating a head-to-toe look and occasion for which you are dressing. Additionally, it will teach you about your accommodations and how clothing interacts with you body. This system is a tool to develop your style, not a body typing system. It takes a holistic view of the body and help us to have \u201cenlightened subjectivity\u201d when looking at ourselves. The journey may be long, but will result in a better understanding of personal style."}, {"header": "Disclaimer", "description": "This is a body positive sub, and Kibbe's styling system is body positive.
