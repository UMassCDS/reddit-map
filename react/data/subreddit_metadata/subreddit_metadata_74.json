Hiibel does not authorize police to demand ID without cause.\nReasonable suspicion/RAS - An explanation of the standard required for a \"Terry Stop\".\nProbable Cause - This is the standard which is required for an arrest, warrant, criminal charge or a search which goes above and beyond an officer safety pat-down.\nAbove all else, remember this when dealing with police:\nPolice are not required to explain themselves or their actions to you or any other person they detain or arrest. A failure to explain their actions to a citizen, either out of malice or ignorance, does not mean a lawful order can be ignored. They are only required to justify their actions in criminal and/or civil court. Do not mistake a lack of explanation for a lack of grounds. Only refuse to identify yourself if you are absolutely certain you stand on solid legal ground.\nDo not attempt to stand up to police officers if you aren't equipped with enough knowledge to make a safe determination of what you're legally required to do and are prepared to endure a false arrest and charges. Any and all resistance must be passive. Never physically resist an officer (exceptions for extraordinarily extra-legal actions notwithstanding). If your rights are violated, seeking compensation will be hampered by any \"bad\" behavior on your part.
