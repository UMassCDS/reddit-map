While posts may OCCASIONALLY seek advice about law school or becoming a paralegal, this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.\nRather than trust strangers on the internet, contact your local resources to get accurate answers.\nWhat Kind of Experience Do I Need to be a Paralegal?\nGraduates of any paralegal program may have the proper education, however, experience is key to any successful paralegal. Many firms will not hire a paralegal right out of any program. If you are able to obtain a position without any law office experience, many firm expectations can be brutal and you should expect to learn by doing while under a lot of pressure. Most firms will expect you to hit the ground running and attorneys can be egotistical, demanding, or stressed out and will rely on you heavily. They will demand that you perform for them on a very high level and a paralegal just starting out may not be experienced enough to take on certain tasks or equipped to handle all of the responsibilities and stress that come with the job.\nMost successful paralegals seek an entry-level position such as a Receptionist, File Clerk, or Legal Secretary for the mere fact that they need to know the inner workings of a law firm beforehand to build their confidence and knowledge. If you are able to obtain this type of position before you graduate, you will have an easier time finding a position as a Paralegal.\nIf you are having trouble landing an entry-level position in the legal world, there are many organizations looking for volunteers where you can glean legal experience, such as becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA). The need for CASA\u2019s is immense and does not require you to have legal background and will give you some exposure to the legal world as well as being a very rewarding experience.\nDo I Need To Be Certified?\nParalegal certification is entirely voluntary in every state, however, a few states allow for paralegals to offer expanded services or work independent of an attorney, and these require state authorization. Understand that getting a certificate for finishing your class is NOT the same thing as becoming a certified paralegal.\nArizona - Paralegals who choose to offer legal document services independently must earn the Legal Document Preparer (LDP) certification through the Board of Legal Document Preparers. https://www.azcourts.gov/cld/Legal-Document-Preparers/LDP-Exam-and-Certificate-Holder-Information\nCalifornia - Independent paralegals that choose to offer legal document preparation services must be registered as Legal Document Assistants (LDA) through the California Association of Legal Document Assistants (CALDA). https://calda.org/page-18117\nWashington State - Paralegals who choose to earn the Limited License Legal Technician (LLLT) designation through the Washington State Bar Association by meeting certain requirements (associate\u2019s degree through an ABA-approved program with specified credit hours in specific courses, plus exams) can actually advise and assist clients on matters that fall within certain practice areas. https://www.wsba.org/for-legal-professionals/join-the-legal-profession-in-wa/limited-license-legal-technicians\nIn any and all other states where voluntary certification is offered, it\u2019s available through the state paralegal associations and does not come with any expanded practice privileges.\nThe state bar associations in Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida offers paralegals the option of earning state certification through the state bar association. The Texas bar association has taken certification one step further by offering certification in one or more of six areas of law. In Indiana, paralegals can voluntarily register through the state bar association, and once accepted, use the credential \u201cIRP\u201d (Indiana Registered Paralegal) provided they meet specified education and experience requirements. The certification and registration options available in these states do not come with the ability to perform expanded functions or the freedom to work without attorney oversight.\nAs in any profession, employers rely heavily on training, education, and experience when choosing whom to hire. The very nature of what is expected of paralegals requires them to have a higher level of education and expertise than in years past, and as a result, many attorneys are setting a higher bar for employment. Lawyers need to be able to put their trust in the paralegals they employ. This has effectively forced paralegals to take it upon themselves to meet high standards if they want to land a job, even though it is not technically required.\nKeep in mind that graduating with a paralegal associates degree is not the same as being certified by an ABA approved program. Some firms require certification from an ABA approved program. In order to know whether your program is ABA approved, search here https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/.\nHow Much Do Paralegals Make?\nParalegal salaries vary greatly by location, practice area, and firm. We have paralegals who make $13 and hour and we have paralegals who make $35 an hour. That said, the median salary of a Paralegal is around $50,000. Obviously, the more education and experience you have, the higher a salary you can demand.\nWhat\u2019s The Difference Between a Paralegal and a Legal Assistant?\nIt all depends on the firm. The terms \u201cParalegal,\u201d \u201cLegal Assistant,\u201d \u201cLegal Secretary,\u201d and \u201cCase Manager\u201d are used differently and sometimes interchangeably. Many firms will only refer to employees as Paralegals if they have their paralegal certificate. Others make no such distinction. When you are job hunting, be sure to find out the duties of the position for which you are applying. Typically the duties of a Legal Assistant or Legal Secretary are more limited than that of a paralegal but, again, it depends on how the firm defines these terms.\nThis sidebar is a work in progress - please message the moderators with suggestions."}]}, "vancouverolgy": {"time_collected": "2023-03-19 23:51:15.084381-04:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "I put in some jokes flairs request if u want a custom flair", "time_posted": "2 years ago"}, {"heading": "Clearly the hood politics account is linked to a gang why is it so 1 sided posts we ask him to post a certain certain they leave us on read and I assume t", "time_posted": "2 days ago"}, {"heading": "Where the new group at??", "time_posted": "5 days ago"}, {"heading": "Canadian Hits: Brothers Keepers", "time_posted": "1 month ago"}, {"heading": "Is it true bk/wp member trap the fish finder on ig who posts dead opps was shot last night in Abbotsford ?", "time_posted": "2 months ago"}, {"heading": "Join a gang", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "Brampton Mississauga Gang Suh gang", "time_posted": "4 months ago"}, {"heading": "2 Killed, 1 Injured In Coquitlam Shooting: \ud83c\udfa5", "time_posted": "4 months ago"}, {"heading": "The Rise & Fall Of BIBO: #6ixademiks #thedirtysurrey #6ixaktv", "time_posted": "4 months ago"}], "subreddits": {}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Discussion on Local Rap Scene and Lower Mainland Gang war", "created": "Created Nov 13, 2020", "stats": ["1.5k Members", "6 Online", "Top 20% Ranked by Size"]}, "other_information": []}, "Phimosis": {"time_collected": "2023-03-19 23:51:32.503817-04:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Sex with phimosis isn\u2019t even bad", "time_posted": "2 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Is there any substance I can use instead of prescribed steroid cream?", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Problems ejaculating during sex", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "I've done it!", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Sex with phimosis", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "I previously had phimosis and I thought I cured it", "time_posted": "10 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Dorsal slit surgery did nothing except making my penis really ugly\u2026 should I just get circumcised?", "time_posted": "4 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Foreskin rollback during sex", "time_posted": "4 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Getting a Frenuloplasty.

Conservative treatment methods are effective in more than 90% of cases for young men.\nThere are three very different types of phimosis.\n\u22c5 The foreskin normally grows with the rest penis. Congenital phimosis results when the foreskin fails to grow. This is a normal developmental condition that occurs in a small fraction of men (around 5%). In most cases it can be resolved with a regimen of gentle tension to stimulate growth.\n\u22c5 Pathological phimosis is a serious inflammatory skin condition also known as lichen sclerosus or balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) that makes the skin grow thin and white and progressively tighter. It may be treatable without surgery if it is diagnose early or it may require surgery. Whether surgery is needed or not, seek professional medical care as soon as possible to avoid dire consequences. If you have any doubt about which type you have, see a doctor to be safe. See r/lichensclerosus for a subreddit about it.\n\u22c5 Adult-onset phimosis is when the foreskin becomes tight after previously functioning normally. It is usually only an issue for old men, but in younger men it may be caused by diabetes. It is probably pathological phimosis. If you have this, you need to see a doctor. This subreddit is not about this issue.\nOther tight foreskin conditions\nFrenulum breve is a condition in which the frenulum of the foreskin is too short restricting retraction. It can cause painful cuts and tears. When it occurs without separate phimosis, it can be corrected with frenulum surgery or foreskin removal (circumcision).\n\u22c5 Urology Online\nPreputial adhesion with intact foreskin is usually a minor skin connection that can be separated (adhesiolysis) with gentle traction over time.\n(Preputial adhesion may also occur as a complication of infant circumcision, in which case it more likely requires surgical correction.)\n\u22c5 Preputial adhesions \u2014 A misunderstood entity\n\u22c5 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: Penile Adhesions\n\u22c5 Penile Adhesion: The Hidden Complication of Circumcision\n\u22c5 British Association of Urological Surgeons: Freeing of Preputial Adhesions\nParaphimosis is when the foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans corona and swells forming a tight band constricting blood flow. It is a common accident medical professionals make with infants. It can be corrected by returning the foreskin to cover the glans.\nHold the penis with one or both hands and press the glans down with the thumb(s) to squeeze the blood out of it to pull the skin back up.\nIf that fails, a compression bandage, washcloth or any other cloth may be used to compress the glans better to squeeze the blood out of it by wrapping the glans in the cloth/bandage tightly.\nIf the entrapment constricts blood flow and cannot be corrected, that is a serious medical emergency. Seek emergency medical attention to avoid severe consequences like gangrene and necrosis.\n\u22c5 Paraphimosis: Current Treatment Options (2000)\nFungal infection (penile thrush/yeast infection/jock itch) is a common problem with phimosis. Fungal infections cause dry, chapped, easily cracked skin that may itch or burn and easily tear. The tears may feel like paper cuts. Fungal infection can make stretching ineffective even with corticosteroid cream.\nIn most cases fungal infections are easily avoided with better hygiene before sleep. Soap is not advised but a clean washcloth should help. It may help to moisturize after washing.\nWhen hygiene alone is insufficient, there are anti-fungal products like clotrimazole cream. Brand names of over-the-counter products include Canesten, Mycelex and Lotrimin AF. They are most effective when applied after washing before going to sleep. If over-the-counter products are ineffective, a doctor can prescribe stronger products.\nDon't use silicone oil with silicone rings. Silicone oil dissolves silicone rubber.\nNo one here can diagnose you. Nothing here constitutes medical advice. If you have any questions or doubts about any advice you may receive here, ask a doctor.\nMore information\n\u22c5 WebMD: Phimosis & paraphimosis\n\u22c5 nhs.uk: phimosis"}]}, "NegarakuMalaysia": {"time_collected": "2023-03-19 23:51:53.937798-04:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Hard Truths In Life.", "time_posted": "5 months ago"}, {"heading": "DS Anwar berjanji akan mendukung bahasa Melayu sebagai bahasa kebangsaan dan melindungi Hak-hak istimewa orang Melayu dan agama Islam sebagai agama rasmi Malaysia.
