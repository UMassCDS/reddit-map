Even (and maybe especially) people that aren't being kind to us. If someone is breaking this rule, please use the report button and we'll sort it out. Many people come here at the worst point in their lives so far and tempers can be short -- be kind to them and you will get kind back.\nKeep it About You: This group is pot-positive and we have no problems with pot other than the fact that it isn't right for us, so we keep this a selfish place. If your problem is with other people, other smokers, or cannabis in general then keep it about how that affect you.\nYou're welcome to talk about bad experiences, but they have to be yours, not other people's, society's, or general anti-smoking opinion. If your post doesn't have \"I\" or \"me\" in it you should question whether you're describing your own experience or just talking about others.\nAlso, this is a politics-free zone. There are lots of thoughts on legalization and plenty of places to debate them, but they are a distraction from the mission of this subreddit which is to help people stop smoking.\nBadges: We get occasional requests for badges -- please see this post: http://bit.ly/K0Y6Hg\nThere is, however, group of /leaves at Chains -- sign up and chart your daily progress with us.\nOther things that will be removed:\nPosts regarding strategies, wait times, products or anything related to drug testing.\nPosts in which the sole subject is tolerance breaks or moderation management. This subreddit is for people who have made the decision to quit for good, not for people who will resume or continue.\nPosts discussing or advocating pot substitutes, CBD, or any remedies other than mutual support and the sharing of our experience. There are medications that can help mitigate the effects of quitting or conditions that might have contributed to addiction, but you should get those from a doctor, not an Internet chat group.\nLinks to outside media -- essays, songs, videos, will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but please understand that they will most (most) likely be removed. These things can be inspiring, but it's better to talk about your inspiration in your own words. Both the writing and the reading are much more helpful to you and everyone.\nThis include your own quitting or vlog videos.

If you can\u2019t find an actual official date, an official release date had not been released yet\nQ: Why did they change the ninja\u2019s design?\nA: The likely reason why the character\u2019s design has changed is to try and give the character more unique and identifiable appearances, and to make the characters in the show\u2019s appearance more closely related to the movie\u2019s appearance.\nQ: Why is Season 11+ under a new show \"Ninjago\" instead of \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\"?\nA: Secrets of Forbidden Spinjitzu and the following seasons are produced by WildBrain Ltd.
