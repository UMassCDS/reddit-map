A user can describe or post a picture of a rollercoaster, and others will try to guess the rollercoaster.\nScoring\nEvery user's score is shown in their flair. Each time a user correctly guesses a coaster they earn one point, and each time a user makes a post, they earn \"post points\" - a 'hidden' score that increments your real score and resets whenever it hits 15 (see more below).\nWhen someone correctly guesses your coaster, reply to them with the command, \"!correct\". Only the first user to guess the coaster correctly should be given the point.\nPost Points\nEach time you make a post, you get a certain number of \"post points\". When this number reaches 15, your earn an actual point on your flair, and your post points reset. To see how many post points you have, comment \"!postpoints\" anywhere on this subreddit. You earn 1 post point for text posts, and 2 for picture posts.\nRules\nThe author of a post can decide how long users must wait to guess again. If no waiting period is specified, you can guess again after the author has replied to your last guess.\nAll text posts must have some identifying information about the coaster in the body. In other words, for all text posts there must be an initial hint.\nAll submissions must have a single correct answer. This means no threads along the lines of \"funniest answer wins\".\nQuestions to obtain more details from the author of a post are only permitted if the author has explicitly allowed it, or it is a yes/no post.\nAll info in a post title and description must be factual. Posts cannot be based on opinions or thoughts of rides, as these are subjective and not fit for this subreddit.\nAll photos posted must clearly show some type of ride. Blurs of colors are not permitted. The decision of whether a photo is a blur of colors or an actual ride will be made at the mods' discretion."}]}, "PLC": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 11:43:37.333629-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "READ FIRST: How to learn PLC's and get into the Industrial Automation World", "time_posted": "2 years ago"}, {"heading": "PLC jobs & classifieds - Mar 2023", "time_posted": "7 days ago"}, {"heading": "Old traumas", "time_posted": "5 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Beginning test on a FS Industrial Switch", "time_posted": "6 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Is it possible to create an AOI to manage arrays without specifying array data type", "time_posted": "2 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Be civil", "Must be on topic", "Ask question in title", "No spam, self-promotion", "No low-effort submissions"], "subreddits": {"Related Communities": {"r/embedded": "119,727 members", "r/robotics": "198,117 members", "r/soldering": "16,216 members", "r/msp": "143,867 members", "r/SCCM": "63,440 members", "r/ElectricalEngineering": "158,131 members", "r/amateurradio": "116,338 members", "r/hobbycnc": "41,081 members", "r/homeassistant": "220,278 members", "r/crestron": "7,247 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "This sub is dedicated to discussion and questions about Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): \"an industrial digital computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.\"", "created": "Created May 6, 2009", "stats": ["54.7k Members", "304 Online"]}, "other_information": []}, "energydrinks": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 11:43:56.609938-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Under 18 and Want to Consume Energy Drinks?

Immediately following severe trauma, the incidence of dissociative phenomena is remarkably high.\nApproximately 73% of individuals exposed to a traumatic incident will experience dissociative states during the incident or in the hours, days and weeks following.\nHowever, for most people these dissociative experiences will subside on their own within a few weeks after the traumatic incident subsides.\nDissociation becomes more maladaptive when it becomes one's primary or only coping method to stress.
