Spoiler Policy\nEverything from the current season, or upcoming seasons including pictures and/or trailers, until two weeks after it ends is considered a spoiler. All posts must be marked/tagged spoiler during that time period and no spoilers in the titles. After the two weeks ends that season is no longer under the spoiler policy.\nComics are always a spoiler and must be marked/tagged in comments and posts.\nHow to mark spoilers in comments do a > and a ! with no spaces then add your spoiler and end it with a ! and a < no spaces. spoiler tag\n2. No Piracy\nWhile we don't care how you source your material it is against Reddit's Content Policy, so keep it off the sub. Do not ask or provide links if anyone asks for them.\nFailure to follow this rule will result in a ban.\n3. Be Civil\nWhile the show itself often contains content and themes that are explicit, divisive, or otherwise objectionable, Discussion, debate, criticism, and disagreement are encouraged, but you must remain civil when doing so.\n4. No Hateful or Discriminatory Speech\nRacism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, misandry, ableism, or any other hatred will not be tolerated. This includes denial or minimization of rape and/or SA and Body Shaming\n5. Content Policy\nRefer to our Content Policy for full details.\n- Fan Art and Cosplays. Please credit the creator when appliable. If it is your creation please state OC in the title.\n- The cast are all actors and, as such, have an extensive history in popular media. Submissions about the cast's performance history (\"cast-spotting\") are not relevant as they do not pertain to The Boys. Announcements of current and future projects that feature one or more cast members in a major role are considered news and permitted.\nSubmissions about guest stars and other TB-adjacent personalities (outside of the context of their appearances on the show) are not relevant to The Boys.\n6. Unrelated Politics\nWhile The Boys covers many political topics and themes, this is not an inherently political subreddit.\nFor further clarification and some examples of what is considered relevant under this policy and what is not, see this thread\n7. Reposts and Spam\nIn an effort to keep the discussion from being too repetitive and fractured, the moderation team will remove duplicate discussions if a similar submission has been made in the last several days or is somewhere near the top of the subreddit.\nFor a thread to not be considered a duplicate, it must offer significant additions to the topic at hand rather than repeating what other users have said in current posts and/or responding to the comments of those posts. Please make comments in existing discussions before duplicating the discussion in a new submission.\nBefore posting content to the subreddit, please use the search feature and/or sort posts by \"New\" to ensure no one else has already submitted the same content. Content deemed to be sufficiently similar to previous posts may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\nFor a non-exhaustive list of frequent posts that may be removed under this policy, please see our list of common reposts\n8. Low-Effort Content\nMost other forms of low-effort content will be removed. This includes self-posts with little to no text and generic joke posts.\nThis includes memes, reaction images, other roles played by the cast, or low effort content (some examples but not all are \"Will [character] show up?\", \"Who would win?\", Character tier lists, fan castings) that does not contain significant commentary relevant to the show. Check the most recent Post-Episode Discussion thread, as it may be more fitting.\n9. Self-promotion\nWhile we do love to see fan-created content, we also don't want the subreddit to become an endless deluge of users promoting their YouTube channels, Etsy stores, etc."}, {"header": "Links", "description": "Season 1 episode discussions\nSeason 2 episode discussions\nSeason 3 episode discussions\nThe Boys Presents Diabolical\nThe Boys Reddit Talks\n  r/TheBoys on Twitter"}, {"header": "Mod Announcements", "description": "After The Episode Drops The Subreddit Is Locked Down For A Specific Amount Of Time.

What is Hobby Drama?\nFor the purposes of our subreddit, a hobby community is \"a group of people who are connected by their active participation in a particular activity during their free time for personal enjoyment\".\nExamples of hobbies include: cosplay, model rocketry, fanfiction, blogging, historical reenactment, gaming, fanart, participating in forums, gardening, cooking, playing sports, composing music, making memes, collecting, backpacking, knitting, reading, and many, many more.\nHobby Drama is an event which happened in a hobby that created meaningful controversy within the community involved. Hobby Drama-worthy events might have ousted someone from the community, shaped perception of the hobby, altered the rules the hobby uses, divided the community, created a new faction, caused significant outrage, etc. They are not blink-and-you'll-miss-it catfights with no consequences or internet influencers being rude to each other.\nWhat is not a hobby? What is NOT Hobby Drama?\nMost drama between professionals is not hobby drama, e.g. professional sports teams, YouTubers, streamers, actors, scientists, etc., unless the professionals are interacting with hobbyists/fans. Current events, news, real-world politics, following a social media account, and being internet famous do not qualify as hobbies. Mods reserve the right to make exceptions for particularly bizarre or niche write-ups.\nDrama must have active involvement by hobbyists to qualify as hobby drama. It cannot be a contained event between professionals where hobbyists had no involvement or no impact on the perception of the occurrence. A TV show finale being bad isn't hobby drama; the fandom reaction leading to it being called 'the worst TV finale ever' might be.\nWhat is a hobby drama post?\nA high-quality, well thought-out post about a dramatic event in a hobby space. Readers overwhelmingly prefer posts which lay out the history, stakes, events, and consequences of the drama, and which include receipts like screenshots or chat logs. Posts should have minimal direct involvement by the poster and not be overwhelmingly biased, and any personal information of participants who are not public figures must be censored.\nWhat is NOT a Hobby Drama post?\nA short paragraph, one liner, a post directly asking for advice or a post that is fabricated or fictional. Please see the wiki for more information.\nA Note on Hobby History\nFor posters who want to infodump about the history of their favorite hobby or a particularly interesting moment in it, we allow Hobby History posts. Hobby History posts do not need to be dramatic. Since they're meant to be historical, they can focus entirely on professionals in a space. They can explain the background events leading up to a dramatic event, or explain the minutiae of how a hobby works; recount a legend of the hobby that\u2019s not quite drama, or just give context on how this hobbyist community works.\nA note on Flair\nIf a post discusses subjects that might be shocking, unpleasant or distressing to readers, it must be flaired Heavy. The NSFW tag should also be used when appropriate. Otherwise, if a post is a Hobby History, it should use one of the blue History length flairs, and if not, one of the red length flairs. The maximum length of a post is 40 000 characters, so an Extra Long post might be more than 25 000 characters, a Long post might be over 15 000, and so on. You can see more information about flairs on the wiki."}, {"header": "Credit", "description": "P.S.
