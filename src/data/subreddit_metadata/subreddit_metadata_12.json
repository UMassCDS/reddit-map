Some exceptions are made, providing that it fits the spirit of the sub.\nWhat this place is not ...\nIn the context of this sub, \"stroke\" is meant to be a play on words as someone has failed with their keystrokes. Posting anything that appears to be mocking the medical condition will be removed and a ban will be considered.\nIf you're seeking support for the medical condition, please visit r/stroke or stroke.org.\nRules and Guidelines\nReminder: reporting is an anonymous way to notify mods you think something doesn't belong!\nRule 1: Relevancy\nPlease see this page for examples of quality content.\nAll submissions should be of .jpg or .png images. Videos, gifs, animations, etc. are not allowed.\nReal strokes are not allowed. Images of a person having a stroke, known to have had a stroke, or appears to be imitating having a stroke are not allowed.\nMeta posts should be reserved for Shitpost Sunday hours (see below)\nEnglish is the preferred language but all languages are allowed. Please note: just because it's not English doesn't automatically make an image worthy of this sub.\nAnything political leaning, especially from politicians, is not allowed.\nCrossposts are not allowed from some subs: you can see the full list here. Please note: we do not allow screencaps from these subs either.\nRule 2: Reposts\nPlease be sure to look through the sub to see if your image has been posted in r/ihadastroke in the past 90 days.\nStrokes that have been \"done to death\" is a list of images that have been reposted so frequently, they are only allowed during Shitpost Sunday hours (see Rule 6).\nThe Fake Facts, Obvious Plant, & WYD/Would You Do It/What Would You Do collections are a series of posts that have a similar format or seem legit but are actually faked images. Click here for examples!\nInstant Reposts are when the image shows someone misspelling one word repeatedly AND/OR when there are only a few typos. Examples!.\nRule 3: Censor Personal Information\nCensor personal information: including usernames, real names, profile pictures, phone numbers, addresses etc. -- especially Reddit usernames. Celebrities and famous people don't have to be censored, but please keep in mind we're not aware of all celebrities: it never hurts to include a comment with who they are.\nRule 4: No Fake/Staged Posts/Memes\nPlease do not submit fake/staged posts.\nMemes are considered fake because they're done intentionally. Some may be allowed during Shitpost Sunday hours (see Rule 6), but this is up to Mod discretion.\nRule 5: No NSFW/NSFL submissions\nNSFW/L posts are NOT allowed, under any circumstance. Posting anything NSFW/L will result in a ban.\nRule 6: \"Shitpost\" Sunday (where the rules are more relaxed)\n\"Shitpost\" Sunday is a time when the rules are more relaxed and things that don't belong during normal hours are OK to post. This happens every Sunday from 00:00 Sun UTC to 00:00 Mon UTC (Click here for current UTC time) or check the sticky posts, they will indicate when the time is right!\nFlair your post! That we can fairly moderate Shitpost Sunday. We will force flairs where we can, but PLEASE flair your posts for the sake of mod sanity.\nRule 2 may be applied, since there are some things that get posted way too often, even during these hours.\nRules 3 & 5 (Censoring Personal Info & NSFW/L) are still enforced as normal.\nMiscelaneous notes about this sub\nJoin our Dicsrod server!\nhttps://discord.gg/FKPeMeb\nPost Flairing\nPost flairs are not required, except for Shitpost Sunday posts. However, if you do not want the mods bringing down their never-ending wrath on you, it may not be a bad idea to add a flair to a post."}]}, "RWBY": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 01:26:33.373222-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Fan Fiction Friday - What have you been reading/writing this week?", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}, {"heading": "Official Discussion Thread - Volume 9, Episode 3: Rude, Red, and Royal", "time_posted": "3 days ago"}, {"heading": "Commission of Willow and Qrow (art by mcmystery)", "time_posted": "10 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Unauthorized Snuggles (Mikkusushi)", "time_posted": "15 hours ago"}, {"heading": "TIME TO LEAVE THEM ALL BEHIIIIND (Dishwasher1910)", "time_posted": "12 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Conduct for Posting", "Source Images", "No Memes/Shitposts", "No NSFW Content", "No Role-Playing", "No Piracy/Leaks", "Submissions must be related to RWBY/No OCs", "No Spamming", "Spoilers"], "subreddits": {"Related Subreddits": {"r/fnki": "33,704 members", "r/roosterteeth": "256,378 members", "r/RWBYOC": "4,686 members", "r/rwbyRP": "1,308 members", "r/GrimmEclipse": "1,511 members", "r/Rwbytabletop": "2,668 members", "r/BeaconRoleplay": "272 members", "r/BestOfRWBYSub": "364 members", "r/NomadOfNowhere": "1,499 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "RWBY: A Rooster Teeth Production (Pronounced Ruby)", "created": "Created Nov 6, 2012", "stats": ["168k Evacuating Atlas", "537 Falling into the void"]}, "other_information": []}, "Gunpla": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 01:26:45.509664-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "[HELP ME] Bi-Weekly Q&A thread - Ask your questions here!", "time_posted": "10 days ago"}, {"heading": "In-Stock Megathread", "time_posted": "1 month ago"}, {"heading": "My custom MG GAT-X103 Buster is done!", "time_posted": "8 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Mg wing with expansion", "time_posted": "10 hours ago"}, {"heading": "[Full Custom MG1/100 Wing Proto Zero]", "time_posted": "4 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Don't be a dick", "Question Post", "Haul Post", "Buying/Selling", "Don\u2019t spam.", "Quality Titles", "Concerning Photoshop", "Blog, YouTube and Social Media postings", "If it's not your build, post the source.", "Off Topic Posts", "No Hateful Content"], "subreddits": {"Related Communities": {"r/Warhammer40k": "590,452 members", "r/minipainting": "1,111,081 members", "r/Warhammer": "296,534 members", "r/Zoids": "14,168 members", "r/Eldar": "34,182 members", "r/ModelCars": "27,229 members", "r/Warhammer30k": "59,948 members", "r/ageofsigmar": "197,128 members", "r/orks": "57,277 members", "r/seraphon": "7,117 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Gunpla (\u30ac\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9) - Gundam and other Mecha Plastic Models", "created": "Created Mar 20, 2010", "stats": ["212k Followers of MG Ball", "669 building a backlog", "Top 1% Ranked by Size"]}, "other_information": []}, "gamecollecting": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 01:27:00.351893-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Game valuation and authentication MEGATHREAD", "time_posted": "27 days ago"}, {"heading": "A vicious cycle I still take part in", "time_posted": "12 hours ago"}, {"heading": "I know no one will believe this\u2026", "time_posted": "8 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Be kind, disagree agreeably, attack the argument, not the poster", "No Price evaluations or authentication posts", "If all you do is SPAM/self promote, it'll be removed and you will be banned.", "Low effort posts will be removed", "Meme Mondays: memes allowed only on the first monday of each month", "Must be related to Game Collecting", "No video submissions", "No affiliate links"], "subreddits": {"Related Communities": {"r/PS3": "163,693 members", "r/ThriftStoreHauls": "2,515,587 members", "r/3DS": "1,015,299 members", "r/HotWheels": "101,179 members", "r/VHS": "36,588 members", "r/footballcards": "126,160 members", "r/MangaCollectors": "1,771,484 members", "r/PokemonCardValue": "11,297 members", "r/basketballcards": "47,139 members", "r/ps2": "115,791 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "This is the definitive Reddit source for video game collectors or those who would like to start collecting interactive entertainment.
