Check the List of California reddits and another list with North American (including Californian) subs\nPosting Rules\nBasic sub rule: Be civil.\nFollow basic reddiquette and reddit site rules.\nNO insults or incivility, trolling, bigotry, or profanity. Nothing that's rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.\nNO doxxing, this includes looking up a user's history.\nNO videos\nNO editorialized titles\nNo memes or image macros.\nNo spam or reposts.\nOriginal sources only. No blogspam or rehosted/republished articles.\nAdditional posts on the same topic without major new changes will be deleted.\nOnly or mostly posting one website is considered self-promotion and is banned from this sub.\nNo live-streaming, podcasts, or animated GIFs.\nNo URL shorteners, archive links, bookmarking links, redirectors, link disguisers, or other websites that hides or changes the final destination URL or source of the original article.\nDo not post links to articles or photos as a text post.\nNo Twitter, Facebook, or personal blog posts.\nNo polls, surveys, petitions, fundraising, or school projects.\nNo /new queue flooding. No more than 1 post/\u00bd hour and 5 posts/day\nAll posts must be current California news and info, plus be of interest to folks from across the state. (Some California history is also cool.)\nNo satire.\nIf a post is of only local interest, or the only connection is a person was born or lives in California or is a company is based in California, or it's entertainment or celebrity news, it is not appropriate. This also includes local crime reports and local politics.\nTry to post more detailed articles from local news sources instead of brief news wire articles from an out-of-state newspaper.\nNo political news unless it is specifically about California or is about California politicians as they relate to California.\nCalifornia is HUGE. If your title doesn't include it, add the location in brackets like this [Santa Ana, CA]. If it is a small city or CDP, include the county or region, eg [Bell, Los Angeles County].\nFor local or regional questions, try /r/AskLosAngeles, /r/AskSF, or /r/AskSanDiego or other local subs instead.\nFor questions, please be as detailed and specific as possible to make it easier to answer your question.\nEspecially if you have a DMV, vacation, travel, working here, or moving here question, please search the sub's archives because it's likely your question has been answered multiple times in the past.\nPlease don't say Frisco, San Fran, The OC, Diego, or Cali. Most Californians don't use those nicknames.\nAll image posts must be by the original creator, have a link crediting the original creator, or have a link to the original source(s) of the image(s). All photos must be high quality images worth posting to one of the SFW Porn Network, such as /r/EarthPorn, and clearly identifiable as a California photo.\nNo ALL CAPS words or text, no bold text, and no #Headline text formatting! This is like SHOUTING and is considered rude. No emoji. \ud83d\ude1f\nNo ALL CAPS TITLES or any ALL CAPS WORDS in titles, even if the original headline was in all capital letters.\nNo missing persons, lost pets, or stolen car posts.\nNo crossposts from other subs on reddit.\nDo not put \"x-post\", \"xpost\", or \"crosspost\" in your title.\nNo posts using the redd.it shortlink. If you link to a post or thread outside /r/California you must use the np subdomain for no-participation mode.\nNo slideshows or multi-page articles.\nNo leading questions or loaded questions.\nIf you ask a question, you must reply to at least one comment within 24 hrs or your post will be deleted.\nAll posts must be in English.\nReddit is not Twitter or txt messaging. Complete sentences and proper spelling are expected. No #hashtags or @at-tags in titles.\nOp-Eds (opinion pieces and editorials) must be labeled [Op-Ed], [Editorial], or [Opinion]. Political columns should be labeled [Political Column].\nQuestions that can be easily answered from the Wikipedia or by a quick Google search will be deleted.\nPlease use descriptive titles. No vague, misleading, or click-bait titles.\nDon't modify article titles except to add a location in brackets unless the title is excessively misleading, vague, or clickbait-ish.

Learn how to get Reddit comment Karma here.\nKeep titles simple and to the point.\nAny specific questions you have concerning artists, albums, or hip hop music subgenres should be in the title of a post, or as a reply to a post. You can expand on your question in the body of the post.\nGuides on hip hop related topics are heavily encouraged and you may be awarded with a \"Quality Post\" flair and added to r/hiphop101's Wiki page.\nWhat Shouldn't I Post?\nDo not post your own music here.\nIf you want music feedback, try r/makinghiphop, but make sure to follow their rules.\nNo self-promotion or networking.\nThis includes either your own or your friend's music, music video, youtube channel, podcast, website, and anything along those lines decided by r/hiphop101's moderation team. That includes the /r/hiphop101 chatroom. This also includes asking to collaborate (networking).\nNot following this rule is most likely to result in a permanent ban, even more likely if there is a history of spamming multiple subreddits.\nNo personally attacking people for their opinions or gatekeeping.\nIt is completely okay to talk about somebody else's opinion and offer your take on it. But, it is against the rules to personally attack people. Calling people names or starting inflammatory arguments to rile people up may result in a temporary ban. Continuing this behavior after a temp ban may result in a permanent ban, depending on post history.\nGatekeeping is someone deciding who does and does not belong here. Excluding other hip hop fans and discouraging their taste in hip hop is not allowed.\nPlease report this behavior. It helps alert the mods to negativity that may be ruining the experience for everyone here.\nNo crossposting to your own profile.\nIgnoring these rules may lead to a permanent ban. Consider the rules before posting.\nMost Importantly\nThis is a place to ask questions/recommendations without worrying about any kind of backlash, so if you know something someone does not, politely educate them rather than berate them.\nLINKS:\nThe Wiki: Guide to Artists, Lyrics, Albums, Resources, & Cities\nDiscord Channel for HipHop101\nr/hiphop101 Reddit General Chatroom\nOther Subreddits you might like:\n/r/90sHipHop\n/r/AcousticOriginals\n/r/Bombing\n/r/freestylerap\n/r/frenchrap\n/r/germanrap\n/r/HipHop\n/r/hiphopheads\n/r/HipHopImages\n/r/importedhiphop\n/r/jazzyhiphop\n/r/makinghiphop\n/r/Metal101\n/r/MusicGuides\n/r/RnB\n/r/RnBHeads"}]}, "MaddenMobileForums": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 06:05:25.775976-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Madden Mobile 23 Megathread", "time_posted": "7 months ago"}, {"heading": "MM23 Weekend Tournament @ /r/ Madden Mobile Forums | #23 TD Fakery", "time_posted": "3 days ago"}, {"heading": "got him in my foil select pack, W pickup?", "time_posted": "10 hours ago"}, {"heading": "There goes my luck for the year. 5+uncommon pack", "time_posted": "17 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Hows the team", "time_posted": "10 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Relevance to Madden Content", "Selling or Trading", "Spamming or Excessive Trolling", "Harassment and Toxicity", "Discussion of Hacks and Glitching", "Low-Effort Content", "League Recruitment (wrong subreddit)", "Self Promotion/Advertising", "Repost/Duplicate Post", "Reddit Content Policy Violation"], "subreddits": {"Find a League": {"r/MaddenMobileH2H": "3,066 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Welcome to the Reddit community for Madden NFL 23 Mobile, the iOS/Android football game by EA Sports.", "created": "Created Nov 17, 2014", "stats": ["45.3k Members", "46 Online", "Top 5% Ranked by Size"]}, "other_information": []}, "AnimeSketch": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 06:05:35.572472-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Official AnimeSketch Discord Server!", "time_posted": "3 years ago"}, {"heading": "AI Generated Images will result in instant bans.", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "I drew Yor, she spilled some drink", "time_posted": "12 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Barefoot Calli (art by me)", "time_posted": "5 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Fluid", "time_posted": "22 hours ago"}], "rules": ["Only Direct Image URLs and Imgur Albums are allowed!", "RESPECTFUL & CONSTRUCTIVE critique and suggestions are permitted on ALL posts.", "Only post art that you've drawn!
