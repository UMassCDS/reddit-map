Social ownership can include common ownership, state ownership or collective ownership. \"Socialism\" can also refer to an intermediate and transitional form of society between capitalism and communism featuring a Dictatorship of the Proletariat (sometimes referred to as \"lower\" or \"the first phase of\" communism).\nMeans of Production: An all-embracing term that describes every non-human material factor involved in the process of socially useful production.\nBourgeoisie: The capitalist class; the ruling class in capitalist society. The social class which owns the means of production and exploits hired labor. The buyers of labor power. This class is made up of a very small minority of the population.\nProletariat: The working class; the class of people in capitalist society who, deprived of any ownership of the means of production, must sell their labor power to the capitalists in order to survive. The exploited class; the producers of surplus value.\nExploitation: Exploitation is making use of some vulnerability in another person in order to use them to attain one\u2019s own ends at their expense. Marxists specifically use the term to refer to the expropriation (theft) of the labor of a worker (via the extraction of surplus value) by the owners of the means of production. Capitalists make their profit from exploitation.\nDictatorship of the Proletariat: A state of proletarian rule where the working class organizes to democratically control the means of production, defend against bourgeois reaction, and create the material basis for a gradual transition to communism. \"Dictatorship\" in this sense does not mean rule by one individual; Marxists view any state as being under the \"dictatorship\" of a class. This term is the antithesis of the \"Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie\" that exists under capitalism where the minority class rules society.\nState: The state, in Marxist terminology, is a mechanism for class rule. It is the primary instrument of political power in class society, consisting of organs of administration, and of force. A state of one kind or another will exist as long as social classes exist.\nFor more definitions see the Dictionary of Revolutionary Marxism or the Marxist Internet Archive Encyclopedia."}]}, "trailerparkboys": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 16:54:34.220229-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "REMINDER - Absolutely NO politics.", "time_posted": "1 year ago"}, {"heading": "Who\u2019s taking the right hook?", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Somebody really went and built Ricky's rink!", "time_posted": "11 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Sometimes you'll get a just right moment", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}], "rules": ["NO TPB Hate", "NO Likenesses", "NO Politics", "NO Self-Promotion, Profiting Or Obvious Karma Farming", "NO Low Effort, OVER-Reposted or Unwanted Content", "NO SPAM", "NO Non-NP Reddit Link", "NOTHING and that means NOTHING Pirated", "No unsolicited PMs to moderation staff"], "subreddits": {"Other Subreddits": {"r/Letterkenny": "244,106 members", "r/CornerGas": "5,433 members", "r/SchittsCreek": "122,301 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Here we 'reddit' about the Trailer Park Boys which is a documentary-style comedy about the inhabitants of Sunnyvale Trailer Park, located in the beautiful Maritime province of Nova Scotia, Canada.

Will I learn Latin?\nA: In > 90% cases, no - you won\u2019t be able to read Latin, and the effects of being subjected to this approach can be long-lasting or even permanent.\nQ: What does it mean to read Latin?\nA: Reading the text and understanding it, perhaps after a few attempts, but without recourse to another language, like you presumably understand English.\nQ: How does one learn to do this?\nA: Language competence is a skill (knowledge-how), and as with any skill, is acquired through a lot of practice, known as Comprehensible Input. Extensive research has shown that factual knowlege (knowledge-that) plays little if any role in successful acquisition.\nQ: Why don\u2019t they teach me this?\nA: A result of the way that Latin has been taught for at least the last 150 years is that teaching or even reading it is beyond many classicists' abilities. Yes, you read that right. Teaching in Latin requires a level of spoken fluency. Reading a lot requires much more time than most programs allow. Standardised tests don't test language proficiency, but must be prepared for. Thus teaching Latin is replaced by teaching about it, and reading it by what used to be the emergency crutch of decoding it. In short, you will need to rely on yourself.\nQ: Is there a course that teaches this?\nA: Luckily there is one - LLPSI, Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata. Written specifically for autodidacts, it's the curriculum most in line with second language acquisition theory, and one of the most praised language courses not just for Latin, but for any language. Here's some of our recommendations on how to use it.\nQ: Don't I need to learn the grammar as well?\nA: Of course. LLPSI teaches you to think about Latin grammar in Latin, and uses only Latin to do it.\nQ: Still, how about combining it with Wheelock's?\nA: Possible but far from seamless due to differences in order and presentation. LLPSI: Latine Disco and A Companion to Familia Romana / Roma Aeterna are designed for this instead. There are better and free intro grammars, but they should be superfluous between LLPSI and a no-nonsense school grammar with succint English and many examples. Moreland & Fleischer seems to be the best of the worst options.\nQ: Where can I get assistance in studying or chat in Latin?\nA:\nIntro Post to the LLPSI Discord Server;\nThe General Latin Discord Server.\nQ: Is Duolingo good for Latin?\nA: It's a supplement for vocabulary and grammar practice. It can't serve as a self-contained language course. Be careful when generalising from its examples.\nQ: Is Google Translate good for Latin?\nA: It's been made much better recently than what it used to be and can be a useful tool, but it still lags behind the major European languages.\nQ: Are translations and bilinguals bad or cheating?\nA: No. On the contrary, they're the next best thing after same-language glosses and free you from the dictionary. But their utility hinges on your ability to see the meaning behind the words (metalinguistic awareness), and on a > 90% level of unaided comprehension.\nQ: More pro tips and fun discussions of language pedagogy?\nA: Ok.\nQ: Gib all your resource now ok.\nA: Ok."}]}, "HMBL": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:01:16.885149-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "New 52wk low", "time_posted": "1 month ago"}, {"heading": "HUMBL Pay removed from app stores.", "time_posted": "1 month ago"}, {"heading": "I can\u2019t buy Hmbl stock, anyone having the same issues?", "time_posted": "2 months ago"}, {"heading": "HMBL is not a scam", "time_posted": "2 months ago"}, {"heading": "HMBL Equity Financing Announcement", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "In Dec 2020, I wrote a long post about why HMBL is a scam in this subreddit", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "Anyone else going to buy in the Dip?", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "FTX Regulation", "time_posted": "4 months ago"}, {"heading": "Top banner change", "time_posted": "9 months ago"}], "rules": ["Respect other people opinions and comments", "Source links must be provided when declaring statements as fact.", "No self promotion, advertising or pumping of other stocks.", "Antagonistic", "Position Verification"], "subreddits": {}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Humbl stock (HMBL)", "created": "Created Dec 11, 2020", "stats": ["5.5k Members", "7 Online"]}, "other_information": []}, "LatinaOnlyFans": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:01:27.997512-05:00", "top_headers": [], "subreddits": {}, "about": {}, "other_information": []}, "OnlineAffairs": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:01:35.316744-05:00", "top_headers": [], "subreddits": {}, "about": {}, "other_information": []}, "NJr4r": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:01:41.048613-05:00", "top_headers": [], "subreddits": {}, "about": {}, "other_information": []}, "Empaths": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 17:01:47.040884-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "EMPATHS DISCORD SERVER is Up and Running", "time_posted": "2 years ago"}, {"heading": "I love all people, but there are some (many) people I don\u2019t want to be around.
