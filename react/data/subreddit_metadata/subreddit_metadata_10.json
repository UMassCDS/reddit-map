Acting in such a manner will result in a warning, temporary ban or permanent ban as the circumstances warrant.\nFor more information on transphobia / fetishization in this subreddit see this post\nErasing people's sexual orientations and/or gender identities (e.g. denying the existence of bisexuality, asexuality, pansexuality, or non-binary gender) is not allowed.\nNo \"Low Effort posts\" This includes selfie posts, bi colors posts, stereotype posts, and other trends. Selfie posts should be posted in /r/BisexualHumans. As \"low-effort\" is a very relative term, the mods will use our discretion to determine what is and is not low effort. For a longer explanation, please see the Post Types section in this post.\nWednesdays and Thursdays are reserved for discussion. This rule is not currently enforced but will be implemented in the future. On these days, no memes or jokes may be posted, only posts that foster meaningful discussion.

These can be physical products or services. The company is structured so that the people above (the person who recruited or signed up the new distributor, the people above them, ad infinitum) get a percentage of whatever the distributor sells. The new distributor is encouraged not only to sell the product, but to sign up other people below them so that they can make even more money. courtesy u/copacetic1515\nWhat is a \"Hun\"?\nPeople who shill products/services for an MLM. The sellers have a tendency to frequently use the word \"hun\" when initiating a sales pitch.

If you know the identity of your bug, do share it with the community!\nCan I submit a dead bug for ID? Yes, but please bear in mind it\u2019s always easier to ID living specimens.

If one is unfamiliar with the taxon, practice diligence, e.g. check other members of the taxon, as well as those of higher taxa. Especially for medically significant bugs, if you aren't 100% sure, leave the ID to someone more knowledgeable.\nID guides tend to be regional. While BugGuide.Net is popular, it only pertains to arthropods in the U.S. and Canada. For bugs outside the U.S. and Canada, try to search for a guide specific to that region.
