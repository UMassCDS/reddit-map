It will also tell you if the code will redeem in SD, HD, or 4K.\nVudu: Go to https://www.vudu.com/ while logged out of your account and use the redeem digital code option. The code is good if VUDU asks you to log into your account.\nFandangoNow: Go to fandangonow.com/redeem while logged out of your account, click on Redeem Digital Movie or TV Code, put in the code. If it asks you to log in, the code is good.\niTunes: From a Mac, open the App Store and try to redeem the code. If it tells you to use it in iTunes, the code is valid. Otherwise it'll tell you that it is dead. For XMLs, put the code in the standard Redeem box, if it's good, it'll tell you to use the disc.\nGoogle Play: For this one, you must be logged in and not already have the movie in your account. Go to the redeem option, put in the code, click redeem. It'll either tell you what the movie is good for, and requires one more click to actually redeem, or it'll tell you that it's been used.\nLionsgate: Go to movieredeem.com or redeemmovie.com and put in the code.

If iTunes is an option, always redeem on iTunes if connected to MA, as this will get you a 4K copy if it is an HD code where 4K is available, and will port a 4K license to MA.
