Submissions regarding FAQ topics will be removed.\nPlease read our following FAQ megathreads before posting:\nAmazon Show FAQ\nNew Player FAQ\nLegendary Edition and The Next Mass Effect game FAQ\nAndromeda FAQ\nShould I play Mass Effect/Is Mass Effect good/Is the Legendary Edition worth it??\nYou are in the Mass Effect subreddit. We all think that the Mass Effect series is great and yes, you should play the games. The Legendary Edition is highly recommended for newcomers to the franchise.\nWhat order should I play the games?\nGenerally, the common consensus is that you should play the games in chronological order, especially if you have the Legendary Edition. The story continues in each game and your character carries over. Start with Mass Effect and end with Mass Effect 3.\nWhat does \"OT\" or \"LE\" stand for?\nIn our sub, \"OT\" stands for \"Original Trilogy,\" and refers to Mass Effect 1-3, excluding Andromeda. \"LE\" stands for the Legendary Edition of the OT, specifically.\nIs the ME3/MEA multiplayer still active?\nYes. Please visit r/MECoOp.\nIs Mass Effect: Andromeda really that bad / worth it?\nAndromeda went on sale pretty soon after release and currently goes down to as little as $5 USD. Here are some threads discussing this topic, but most users will say that the game is worth getting and trying at the discounted price.\nDo I need to play the OT before playing Andromeda?\nTechnically, no. However, it is generally highly recommended you do so, as playing the OT will greatly enhance your understanding of MEA.\nShould I play the OT or the LE?\nThe LE makes significant overhauls to ME1 and includes all DLC. For these reasons, the fandom consensus is that the LE is the best way to experience the trilogy. Check out our LE FAQ post linked above for details on the differences between the two.\nHow to I successfully complete the ME2 Suicide Mission?\nCheck out our \"Relevant Links\" section of the sidebar for a key. Warning: it may have spoilers!\nWhat is the \"Perfect Destroy Ending\" and how do I achieve it?\nThe \"Perfect Destroy Ending\" is the moniker fans have given to one of the specific available endings to Mass Effect 3. Telling you what it means would be a spoiler, but you can read about it (with spoilers) in the Priority: Earth Wiki article. To achieve this ending in the original trilogy, you had to have made certain decisions, have an Effective Military Strengths of at least 3,100 with the Extended Cut DLC, and choose the \"red\" ending. These requirements were changed in the Legendary Edition. Galactic Readiness does not exist, as multiplayer was removed. All War Assets are at 50% effectiveness and there is no Effective Military Strength value displayed in-game; only Total Military Strength. To obtain this ending in the LE, you will need at least 3700 Total Military Strength. Check out the War Assets Wiki article for more information on how these numbers work.\nWhat counts as spoilers here?\nAt this time, almost nothing from the original trilogy and Andromeda are considered spoilers. If you are new to the series and don't want to see spoilers, it is highly recommended that you keep distance from the subreddit until you are ready. Even though a remaster has come out and we very much welcome new fans to the community, the newest addition to the story (Andromeda) is now 4 years old and the oldest (ME1) is 14. We recommend that new fans assume that all posts in this subreddit will contain spoilers (because they will). Unfortunately, it is simply not possible for mods to police spoilers for four whole games. The only type of spoiler we will remove and punish is purposeful spoiler-trolling and we will still require major spoiler posts to be tagged with the spoiler tag. When the next game comes out, we will be able to manage spoilers for that. Lastly, we do not police spoilers for other franchises. We will not remove spoilers for other games, TV shows, etc.\nAre mods making money from the subreddit or referral codes?\nNope, never. It is against Reddit policies for moderators to be compensated for moderating. We have never accepted any gifts, payment, or even so much as accepted a free game code. Please see this post for information about how we are using 100% of the profits from our Bioware Gear Store referral codes to fund giveaways and events for the subreddit.\nWhy is [insert topic] banned/not allowed?\nwhy memes are not allowed\nregarding certain uses of the word \"rape\"\nThe Expanse show is only banned in posts because it is simply posted about too much. To this day, we still get frequent posts about it even after the ban. This sub was becoming r/theexpanse instead of r/masseffect, so we banned the topic in order to keep this subreddit relevant. Rule 2 states that all posts must be primarily related to ME and the posts about The Expanse were not. Ultimately, discussing the merits of another show frequently in this sub was too derailing and the discussions were rarely about making actual parallels between ME and the show. Many of us on the mod team love The Expanse and encourage fans to visit r/theexpanse.\nthe other banned topics are banned because they inevitably result in comment sections devolving into bigotry and/or incivility."}, {"header": "Credits", "description": "Custom Snoos created by u/Throwaway_4_opinions\nBanner by u/raiskream"}]}, "OnePiece": {"time_collected": "2023-03-06 17:39:39.141217-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "One Piece: Chapter 1077 - Predictions", "time_posted": "16 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Happy Monday!

No exceptions.", "created": "Created Jan 25, 2008", "stats": ["2.3m Members", "6.1k Online"]}, "other_information": [{"header": "Posting Guidelines", "description": "EXAMPLES OF CONTENT RESTRICTED IN /R/SEX:\n1) PROMOTIONAL POSTS. This means any post containing any kind of promotional element, especially one which seeks to lure traffic to another site or promote a product. Links to specific product descriptions are permitted if they\u2019re PRECISELY on-topic in the context of the post, AND the post itself is clearly seeking advice in good faith. If you're trying to sell something, conduct market research, etc - these posts will get you banned. Linking to sex-positive blogs or podcasts is allowed, provided you make an effort to start a conversation here about the topic and use the link as supporting material.\n2) LINK POSTS. Linked material must be sex positive and precisely on-topic to stay up here, and needs to be introduced with a workable framework for discussion. Please see the posted Link Policy BEFORE you post links! Bare links to youtube, images, blogs, podcasts, etc are prohibited.\n3) ACHIEVEMENT POSTS. These include appreciation, humblebrags, \u201cI just had to share,\u201d \u201cI just want to say,\u201d etc. These belong in the Daily Sexual Achievement Thread, not in the main forum. Posts which are JUST sex stories belong somewhere else entirely \u2014 like r/sexstories or a similar forum.\n4) LOW EFFORT MATERIAL. \u201cDoes anyone else...?\u201d, \u201cIs [X] normal/weird?\u201d, \u201cIs [y] wrong/bad/okay?\u201d, and so forth. Human sexuality is incredibly varied; yes, someone else likes what you like, and labels like \"normal\" or \"weird\" are meaningless and in a sex positive community, we do not allow any moral judgments against sex acts or behaviors that are consensual. Title-only posts, posts with no effort at an actual conversation will be removed and may get you banned. Comments that consist of nothing but memes, \"this\", \"lol\" and such are highly disfavored. If comments do not further the discussion, they may be removed; a pattern of these may result in your ban.\n5) SEEKING FAP MATERIAL. Do not ask for sex stories, do not ask for the hottest/strangest/most unusual/etc encounter someone ever had. Do not ask for lists of other people's kinks or fantasies.\n6) PORNOGRAPHY, EROTICA, OR PERSONALS. You may not post or link pornography or erotica here. You may not share pictures of your genitals here - even if you are seeking medical advice (if you need to post a picture, you need to be going to a doctor). You may not recruit sex partners here, look for dirty chat, ask for someone to private message you, etc.\n7) DISRESPECTFUL CONTENT. Personal attacks, insults, name calling, or disrespect of any sort are not allowed here. Sexism, racism, or any type of hate speech will result in your immediate ban. This is a community for ALL GENDERS - refusing to acknowledge a trans individual's gender flies in the face of this, and will result in your ban.\n8) OPINION SEEKING, POLLS, VALUE JUDGMENTS OR VALIDATION POSTS. This forum is not for simply collecting opinions - \"do you think [X] is hot?\", \"Women, do you like [Y]?\", \"What is your favorite sex position?\" and so forth. This is not a forum to discuss your penis size, breast size, labia size, ask about other body image issues, or ask for feedback on your photos. See the /r/sex FAQ for help regarding body image issues. Do not post your pictures and ask people to rate or critique you.\n9) ACADEMIC SURVEYS. These require prior moderator approval. Moderators will review the question formats and will review the documentation of institutional ethical oversight (please provide). Non-academic surveys are seldom allowed. Please contact the moderators BEFORE you post a survey or study.\n10) GENERAL RANTS, ESSAYS, EDITORIALS, VENTS, CONFESSIONS, PSAS AND AMAS. These don\u2019t belong in the main forum unless you have obtained prior moderator approval. Save them for story-based forums. Or Tumblr.\n11) FREQUENT/FAMILIAR TOPICS. These are addressed in either the FAQ, past posts, or both. In case you are confused, this means that we do not do penis size posts here.\n12) VAGUE TITLE/TOPIC. If a moderator can\u2019t identify your issue or the type of advice you\u2019re seeking, your post will be subject to removal. Titles should be at least several words long and adequately express what your post is about.\n13) NONCONSENSUAL OR ILLEGAL CONTENT. /r/sex is for the discussion of consensual sex among adults. We do not permit posts that advocate pedophilia, bestiality, rape, or incest here under any circumstances, nor do we allow these topics at all in most instances. Note that BDSM and CNC (consensual nonconsent) are perfectly valid topics in /r/sex.\n14) OTHER OFF TOPIC ISSUES. This is not the place to discuss politics or religion, to seek dating advice, to ask for how to pick up women, to rant about how you have never had sex. Posts that appear to be dedicated to stirring up arguments - particularly about hot button topics like circumcision, the evils of pornography and/or masturbation, and other toxic subjects - will be removed and will result in swift bans.\n15) IMPORTANT NOTE ON DISCUSSIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. Sexual assault is an important and emotional topic which can be discussed (constructively) in r/sex. But posts which simply seek opinions about whether a given scenario counts as sexual assault do not do well here. This is true for several reasons, including the fact that assault laws vary by jurisdiction, and we don't encourage debates about jurisdiction issues here. Therefore, we ask that you refrain from describing a scenario and then simply asking \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d Instead, ask for specific advice: About how to respond to the scenario, how to avoid it, or how to proceed with next steps. Posts which simply ask \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d are subject to removal without notice.\nFurther information about the /r/sex rules and policies can be reviewed on the rules page."}]}, "reddevils": {"time_collected": "2023-03-06 18:34:08.106117-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Daily Discussion", "time_posted": "34 minutes ago"}, {"heading": "[James Ducker] \"United\u2019s players reported at 9am as planned on Monday for a recovery session and analysed the capitulation back with Ten Hag\" | \"But sources said the focus was very much on getting the defeat out of their system quickly and ensuring there is an immediate response against Real Betis\"", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "[@MarcusRashford] I wish we could play a game today to try and put things right.
