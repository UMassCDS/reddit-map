For a more in-depth description of endometriosis (or \"endo\"), please check out this article by the Center for Endometriosis Care.\nWe believe current research tells us that expert excision of lesions is the gold standard treatment for endometriosis and this often includes the use of hormones post surgery (though not always) - however, we also believe in supporting each other wherever we are on the journey to pain-free living and through whatever choices we make.\nNo one's disease is exactly the same, neither are treatment goals, access, or financial ability.

Must be provided at the time of posting.\nNote:\nWe suggest you use PayPal Good and Services rather than Friends and Family for your own protection\nNo Links to Outside Ads.\nTimestamps:\nWe require a timestamped picture of items that you're selling to prove that you actually own the item. Please upload your timestamps to Imgur, Google drive, or Dropbox. Other image hosts may confuse our automoderator.\nYour timestamp photo must contain:\nDate in DD/MM/YYYY and your Reddit username written out on a scrap of paper or sticky note. Date must be no older than 3 days of your date of posting.\nThe item you're selling. If the item is used, the photo must be of the actual item and not only the box. If the item is BNIB, the photo must clearly show that the box has not been opened (i.e., include the security seal on the package in your photo).\nAfter Posting:\nSet the appropriate Flair for your post.\nCheck back often to reply to comments.\nReposting:\nReposts for the same thread may be reposted once every 72 hours.\nNew threads can be made every 24 hours. Must not contain the same item(s) that have been posted before within the past 72 hours. This includes deleting the old thread and bumping the item using the new thread.\nDO NOT post personal information, yours or anyone else's. This includes name, phone number, street address, email, etc\nPlease refer to the anti-scam guide from /r/hardwareswap for safe buy/sell practices.\nWe are not liable if you get scammed. We HIGHLY recommend checking the user's trade history and only using payment methods which provide some degree of buyer protection.\nAT THE TIME OF POSTING, every post must contain an image with the listed hardware and a HANDWRITTEN time-stamp. Time-stamp must include the username and a date no older than three days and should be clearly written on a piece of paper. Unless a product is clearly, visibly FACTORY SEALED, a timestamp of the PRODUCT and not just the BOX is necessary.\n*Backseat moderating, and rudeness of any sort are not allowed. Following subreddit etiquette is considered a rule here and warnings/punishments are at the discretion of the moderators. If you see a post that does not follow the rules it is easier to report it and get a moderator to contact the user than causing an argument. *\nNew Rules by popular demand:\nIf you are selling an item that is reliant on mechanical parts I.E GPU with Air or water cooling, CPU cooler (Air or liquid). Or anything else that has mechanical moving parts you must give the history of the item if it has been highly utilized during its lifetime. I.E Crypto Mining, AI Simulation, Graphics rendering.\nFilter by:\nSelling\nBuying\nSelling\\Trading\nRelated Subreddits\nHardware Swap Subreddits\n/r/hardwareswap\n/r/HardwareSwapEU\n/r/HardwareSwapUK\nSale Subreddits\n/r/bapcsalescanada\n/r/buildapcsales\n/r/buildapcsalesuk\nComputer / Hardware Subreddits\n/r/buildapc\n/r/hardware\n/r/battlestations\n/r/pcmasterrace\nComputer Help Subreddits\n/r/buildapcforme\n/r/buildmeapc\nOther PC Related Subreddits\n/r/GameDeals\n/r/steamgameswap"}]}, "googlehome": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 10:19:33.652669-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "FAQ: Please read the subreddit FAQ before posting similar questions!
