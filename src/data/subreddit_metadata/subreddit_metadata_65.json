Debate is welcome and encouraged; duels and other disrespectful behavior, however, are strictly forbidden and may result in removal of your posting privileges.\n2) Do nothing to provoke legal action. The use of cameras or video/audio recording devices in a theater is illegal copyright infringement. Do not discuss illegal activities or illegally obtained material in this subreddit.\n3) Be inimitable, an original. All posts and comments to this subreddit must contain content that came from your own brain or hand. Standards for originality/appropriateness of content are subject to moderator discretion.\nStandalone quotes of lyrics from the musical are just that, quotes, not original content.\nExceptions are made for photos of a theater stage/ticket stubs/Playbill/merchandise: These photos are allowed in the appropriate megathread.\n4) We won't follow the money to see where it goes. Buying and/or selling tickets on the secondary market is risky, and /r/hamiltonmusical and its moderating team is maintaining deniability by forbidding buying/selling of tickets on this subreddit. We strongly recommend using a trusted secondary market platform such as Verified Tickets by Ticketmaster or StubHub.\nThat's it, really.\nRelated subreddits:\n/r/Broadway\n/r/musicals\n/r/UnexpectedHamilton\n/r/hamiltonmemes\n/r/InTheHeights\n/r/ItsClippingBitch\nAffiliated subreddits:\n/r/heathersmusical\nFAQ\nLocated here.
