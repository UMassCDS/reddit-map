Don't worry that much about where your bug report should go: bug triagers will move it to the correct place. :)\nWhat about widgets? They don't look like standalone programs and I don't know their name!\nDefault widgets should be reported under the product Plasmashell. Third-party widgets should be reported to their respective devs.\nI have no idea how to report crashes!\nSee how to create useful crash reports, how to debug Plasmashell and widgets, and how to debug KWin. You will need to install debug symbols, depending on your distro you might already have them enabled (e.g. openSUSE), you might have to perform additional steps to enable them (e.g. Kubuntu). After that, creating a full backtrace is just a matter of attaching GDB to a process and waiting for it to crash:\ngdb -pid $(pidof NAMEOFPROCESS) -batch -ex \"set logging file APPLICATIONNAME.txt\" -ex \"set logging on\" -ex \"continue\" -ex \"thread apply all backtrace\" -ex \"quit\"\nWhere can I contribute with patches?\nAfter the move to Gitlab, we stopped using Phabricator for sending patches entirely.

If unavailable in your distro, install qt5ct and set QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct.\nTo make Dolphin look good with ssh X forwarding or Waypipe on a Plasma session, you need to set DESKTOP_SESSION=kde. If you don't want to add this to your ssh command every time, set it in ~/.ssh/environment.\nAfter updating my Plasma from git installation (KDE neon Unstable/openSUSE Krypton/Arch KDE Unstable) my system has suddenly gotten several issues despite new users not suffering from them!\nTry deleting ~/.cache after a problematic update, and especially before bugtesting. Typically cache gets invalidated/cleaned whenever a new application version is installed, but in systems with daily builds such versions often do not change, as they're different builds of the same version. This might lead to unexpected bugs that are not generally reproducible.\nSettings are spread all over my config folder, it's annoying!\nIf it bothers you so much, configure all KDE applications with XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config/KDE, this should force your applications to use that folder instead of ~/.config.
