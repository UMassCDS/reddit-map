Linux differs from the disgustingly proprietary operating systems like Windows and Mac OS by being open and freely influenced by anyone with the necessary desire and abilities.\nWhy use Linux?\nLess malware than OSX and Windows.\nIt's faster and more efficient than OSX and Windows.\nNo bloatware included.\nYou can make your desktop look however you want. Literally.\nYou can update all your computer's software with a single click.\nRuns on pretty much anything, no matter how old it is.\nYou can see every line of code it uses, so you know there's no NSA backdoor. They tried (and failed) to get a backdoor inserted into Linux. There are also no keyloggers built-in, unlike in Windows\nIt costs exactly $0.\nAccording to Gabe Newell, it's the future of PC gaming (as is SteamOS).\nBy using it, you ascend even higher into the /r/PCMasterRace\nAlso check our wiki (WIP)\nRules\nWe trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:\n#1) Respect the privacy of others.\n#2) Think before you type.\n#3) With great power comes great responsibility.\nFor expansions on the three basic rules, view the full rules page here.\nAdditionally, posts that are Microsoft/Windows related may only be posted on Mondays. Posts including Microsoft/Windows that also relate to Linux might be allowed according to moderator discretion.\nPlease check that it is Monday on UTC before posting something MS or Windows related!\nI use Windows or Mac alongside Linux. Can I join the Linux Master Race?\nAlas, currently the Mac squids, and even more so the Windows krill, do not realize the inevitable triumph of the Linux OS. This is an unfortunate fact, and it may force many penguins to use the crude systems of the seafood. Even if persecuted in this way, as long as one believes in the supremacy of Linux, one may become a member of the Linux Master Race. One day the trials will end and we shall rise above all, but use the systems of the squids and krill for what you need and only for what you need, and persevere in the hope of the future.\nHeader by

If you want a tour of someone's island, ask permission first - same goes with visiting shops and purchasing items.\nDon't pick up items unless the host said it was okay. Star fragments, glowing moss, flowers, even sticks or rocks could be part of someone's set up - please be respectful and never remove an item from someone's island unless they tell you directly that it is OK!\nLeave through the airport, and not with the - button. By pressing the - at the top of your switch, you are resetting the entire game for the host and anyone else on the island - items purchased, sold, recipes learned, and even the position of the NPC will change when you hit the - button.\nDon't shake trees, pick flowers, or veggies without permission.\nBE NICE. If you're not sure if something is okay, ask. Don't be a jerk.\nDon't place a custom design in someone's Ables or message on a bulletin board without their permission FIRST. Custom designs in Ables will be worn by the villagers on the island and having to remove them will \"grief\" the host.\nAs a guidance, banned users can still see posts, and message users here. If you want to be safe, require users to comment for participation. A user who has been banned for scamming can not comment. This is why we suggest you place Dodo codes in DM only! It also allows you (and mods) to better know who is coming to your island, and when. Be safe!\nDO have fun! DO reach out if you aren't sure about something! Communicate if you aren't sure. Our community is lovely and most hosts will love it if you stay to fish or hunt bugs or pick fruit; it's just kind to ask.\nKeep Animal Crossing wholesome :)"}]}, "Instagram": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 03:43:02.255605-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Weekly Tech Support Megathread", "time_posted": "21 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Follow Friday/Follow Chain - Share Your Usernames & Find New People To Follow!", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}, {"heading": "Meta Verified?", "time_posted": "13 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Reposted instagram stories are cut off", "time_posted": "17 minutes ago"}, {"heading": "Massive drop on reach suddenly why? 39k followers .. my other 3K account has over 400k in reach", "time_posted": "20 hours ago"}, {"heading": "I have a problem", "time_posted": "2 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Something Went Wrong.
