It's short for emotive hardcore. These bands are often tagged \"harDCore\" or \"Revolution Summer\" bands, and include artists such as Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Fuel. Later on, the \"emocore\" label was attached to bands such as Lifetime, Hot Water Music, and Jawbreaker.\nAs time went on, Emo bands started to experiment more with loud/soft dynamics, intricate melodies, heavy build-ups, and twinkly guitar work. At the core of these bands lied a commitment to the DIY ethic and an embrace of sincerity. This is the most pure distillation of \"emo,\" although far from the only iteration. A few of these bands would be Moss Icon, Native Nod, Navio Forge, Indian Summer, and Still Life. There was also a small subset of bands, mostly in San Diego and later Berkeley, who made the sound more frenzied and fractured, typified by artists who frequented the Che Cafe and Gilman Street, such as Heroin, Antioch Arrow, Portraits of Past, Clikitat Ikatowi, and John Henry West.\nMidwest Emo is a style of indie rock that takes from the song structure (and occasionally vocal style) of the previous emo bands, but imbues it with pop sensibilities and a more gentle touch. The artists are sometimes referred to as \"post-emo indie rock\" or \"indiemo\". Cap'n Jazz is usually cited as the original midwest emo band. Other notables include Sunny Day Real Estate, Christie Front Drive, Boys Life, and Mineral.\nScreamo is an aggressive offshoot of Emo characterized by yelled or screamed vocals and dissonant, twinkly guitar work. Screamo bands usually shy away from conventional song structures and often play around with loud/soft dynamics. Because screamo is often used as a catch all term for all genres with unclean vocals, many screamo fans often refer to true screamo as skramz. Saetia, William Bonney, L'Antietam, I Have Dreams, and the Kidcrash are a few examples of screamo bands. There are also screamo bands that experiment with post-rock and progressive rock tendencies, such as Gospel, Circle Takes the Square, and City of Caterpillar.\nEmoviolence is a fusion genre of screamo/emo with powerviolence, beginning in the mid-to-late 90s in the American Southeast before spreading up the coast and across the world. Orchid, pageninetynine, In/Humanity, Palatka, and Usurp Synapse are a few notable examples.\nEmo Pop sprouted from the crossover of pop-punk and Midwest emo bands, but also includes pop-punk bands with a heavy emocore influence. Artists range from the Get-Up Kids and the Promise Ring, to Taking Back Sunday, to even the early work of Fall Out Boy.\nRecently, there has been a renewed interest in emo, especially midwest emo. These bands are heavily influenced by Cap'n Jazz and often have a strong bent towards math rock and post-rock in their song structure and guitar work. A few examples of these twinkledaddy bands are Street Smart Cyclist, Snowing, Algernon Cadwallader, The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, and Glocca Morra. As this scene grew and grew in popularity, #emorevival became a near-mainstream style of indie rock which took from various facets of Midwest, screamo, and emo pop, as played by bands such as the Hotelier, Free Throw, and late-period You Blew It!.\nThere is even an emo pop revival scene centered around Midwest-influenced indie rock bands with mildly intricate guitar work and deeply personal, confessional lyrics. These bands include Modern Baseball, Sorority Noise, and the Front Bottoms. Within this scene is a style known as sparklepunk, which combines Braid-like \"jolly\" twinkles with lo-fi, noodly college rock guitar work, built around a base of pop-punk. Sparklepunk bands include Mom Jeans, Darkle, and Donovan Wolfington.\nThe following are examples bands are NOT EMO but are very influential or popular within the scene: Weezer, The Cure, the Smiths, Fugazi, Slint, Nation of Ulysses, Drive Like Jehu, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, Built to Spill, Pinegrove, and Remo Drive."}, {"header": "Related subreddits", "description": "/r/screamo\n/r/emoscreamo\n/r/emo_trap\n/r/emojerk\n/r/EmoPeopleTwitter\n/r/emovinyl\n/r/posthardcore\n/r/mathrock\n/r/indie_rock\n/r/indieheads\n/r/sparklepunk\n/r/MidwestEmo\n/r/Rojava"}]}, "dreamcatcher": {"time_collected": "2023-03-08 13:52:09.604199-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "InSomnia Weekly Discussion Thread 04-03-2023", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}, {"heading": "2023 Dreamcatcher Tour 'Reason: Makes Dreamcatcher 2023' Megathread", "time_posted": "2 months ago"}, {"heading": "Yoohyeon", "time_posted": "4 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Serious Handong", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}], "subreddits": {"Related Communities": {"r/kpop": "2,081,025 members", "r/bangtan": "576,044 members", "r/TheWeeknd": "157,559 members", "r/GFRIEND": "28,665 members", "r/seventeen": "41,442 members", "r/twice": "248,758 members", "r/straykids": "121,937 members", "r/TheFence": "28,558 members", "r/LOONA": "96,822 members", "r/gratefuldead": "147,936 members"}}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "Subreddit for Dreamcatcher, a K-pop girl group under Dreamcatcher Company.

Avoid a diet high in dietary fat content and sugar.\nCleaning Vulva & Vagina: Clean only the outside of the vagina with gentle, unscented bar soap like Dove or Ivory. DO NOT DOUCHE! It eliminates helpful bacteria and increased risk of infection. Use unscented, dye free soaps, especially on the hands, anal areas, and genital areas, both yours and your partner\u2019s. Use a clean, previously dry washcloth or towel each time the vulva is cleaned or dried. Wipe or pat the vulva gently after urinating; excessive wiping can damage your skin. Cleaning with warm water after urinating or having a bowel movement can help some women.\nKeeping the Vulva Dry: Gently but thoroughly dry the vulva after bathing or showering; you can use a hair dryer on low to accomplish this! Sleep without underwear to increase circulation. Cotton underwear with a cotton crotch is most breathable. Avoid staying in a wet bathing suit.\nAvoid Irritants: Use unscented and dye-free detergents for your underwear. Consider double rinsing your underwear to eliminate any soap residue. Avoid pads and pantyliners unless needed; and try a variety of pads to find the least irritating.\nAltering Sexual Practices: Only clean objects should touch or enter the vagina (that goes for anything! Fingers, toys, penises, other vaginas, etc). Use a water-based lubricant to prevent chafing during sexual intercourse Try a variety of pH balanced lubricants to find the least irritating one for you. Clean objects (including fingers, penis, sex toys) with soap and water after contact with the anus before they touch the vagina to avoid spreading germs. Consider condoms or pulling out with recurrent infections, as semen may affect the pH of the vagina, especially with frequent intercourse.\nChoosing Birth Control: Spermicides may irritate the vagina. Oral contraceptives alter the vaginal flora in some people, increasing their risk of vaginitis. Consider alternative forms of birth control for recurrent, severe vaginitis."}, {"header": "Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma", "description": "Treatment Guidelines for Mycoplasma: https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/mycoplasmagenitalium.htm\nWikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_genitalium"}, {"header": "External Genitalia Gallery", "description": "http://gynodiversity.com/uploads/Classification_of_the_anatomical_variation_in_female_external_genitalia.pdf"}, {"header": "Abortion Resources", "description": "https://digitaldefensefund.org/ddf-guides/abortion-privacy START HERE to protect your privacy and keep yourself safe!\nr/StrikeForRoe\nr/auntienetwork is a place to connect \"Aunties\" willing to provide assistance to those seeking abortions in the US\nr/abortion is a support group for those who have had abortions\nr/birthcontrol has a lot of great information on the efficacy of various contraceptive methods on their sidebar as well as some great links to resources in case contraception fails\nr/childfree also has great resources to find providers who provide tubal ligations etc\nhttps://abortionfunds.org/ \"The National Network of Abortion Funds builds power with members to remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion access by centering people who have abortions and organizing at the intersections of racial, economic, and reproductive justice.\"\nhttps://www.mahotline.org/ an informational hotline on how to manage miscarriage or abortion at home\nhttps://crisispregnancycentermap.com/cpcs/ lists information on how to avoid dishonest Crisis Pregnancy Centers whose primary aim is to prevent abortion access\nThe next few links contain information on how to obtain an abortion safely:\nMaster list of resources https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xp20INMkS0wKsFPocrK6jt8XsewcDE4GnGVhu0fwLt0/edit\nMirror link of above https://www.docdroid.net/s3OwS8u/pro-choice-resource-masterpost-pdf\nhttps://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/ *note: it is not recommended to insert pills vaginally as remnants could be found that didn't dissolve.\nhttps://consult.womenhelp.org/get-abortion-pills?z_language=en\nhttps://www.abortionfinder.org/\nhttps://www.ineedana.com/\nhttps://aidaccess.org/"}, {"header": "Artwork", "description": "Black Iris Artist: Georgia O'Keeffe (American, Sun Prairie, Wisconsin 1887\u20131986 Santa Fe, New Mexico) Date: 1926 Medium: Oil on canvas Dimensions: 36 x 29 7/8 in.
