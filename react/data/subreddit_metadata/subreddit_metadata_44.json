Other forms include epistemological nihilism, mereological nihilism, and political nihilism.\nAs with any other philosophical label, there is diversity within nihilism and disagreement over what counts as nihilism. Labels with some overlap include existentialism, absurdism, fatalism, and pessimism. Some people embrace nihilistic conclusions as a philosophical matter, while other people relate to nihilistic themes more as a matter of intuition, personal experience, or personal expression.\nWe don\u2019t intend to depress you.
