Contributing

To contribute to Reddit Map, you can help in the following ways:

Bug reports
Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/iDPI-Umass/reddit-map/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

Pull requests
Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests. The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged. Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.
