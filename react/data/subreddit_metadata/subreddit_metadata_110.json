This includes making threads, posting comments, and replies.\nDon't make duplicate posts. Scroll through to see if your topic was recently posted. Duplicate discussion or link posts will be removed.\nIf you make an episode discussion thread, USE THIS FORMAT: \"Air Crash Investigation: [Title] (SxxExx) Link & Discussion\" In additon, please try to keep the thread updated with a working link in the OP so other redditors don't have to risk spoilers searching for links in the comments. ONE DISCUSSION THREAD PER NEW EPISODE. We will sticky 1 or 2 discussion threads of the most recent episodes.\nAll NSFW material must have an \"NSFW\" tag in capital letters\nDo not post photographs or videos of bodies of victims at the crash site.\nMemes, shitposting, sharing anything about the show or aviation incidents in general are permitted. Try to avoid revealing causes of incidents/accidents for memes about stories of new episodes.\nKeep politics out of this subreddit unless it is related to a discussion or suggestion of an episode(s).\nDo not make posts that repeat the same reports about current events relating to a recent aviation incident/accident. Posts about new major revelations are permitted to a degree.\nHave fun!"}]}, "reclassified": {"time_collected": "2023-03-20 17:14:43.772890-04:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "r/hungtwinks banned", "time_posted": "5 hours ago"}, {"heading": "r/smellyfeet, r/Stinkyfeet, r/dirtyfeet, r/feetfinder, and r/feetfinders banned", "time_posted": "3 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Why was r/Jim banned?", "time_posted": "3 minutes ago"}, {"heading": "r/Gayspiderbrothel banned", "time_posted": "1 day ago"}, {"heading": "r/leaksbydaylight banned", "time_posted": "1 day ago"}, {"heading": "r/rockandstone banned", "time_posted": "2 days ago"}, {"heading": "r/antiyoungpeoplereddit banned", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}, {"heading": "r/unculturedswine banned", "time_posted": "7 days ago"}], "rules": ["Must be banned or quarantined", "Follow the Reddit rules", "Concern and outrage trolling", "No Off Topic Content", "No links to alternatives to banned subreddits", "No archives of banned subreddits", "No content policy breaking user names."], "subreddits": {}, "about": {"header": "About Community", "description": "We track and discuss banned and quarantined subreddits. **Important note:** We are not a hub for banned communities to congregate, nor do we endorse the creation of alternate communities to banned or quarantined subreddits.
