For more serious wrestling discussion, we recommend r/Wreddit.\nThere is a minimum karma requirement to post on this subreddit.\nTHE RULES\n1. No screencaps, links or summoning from other subs. Other wrestling sub users, unlike literally every other large sub, cannot cope with being called out on their jerkiness. Therefore DO NOT SCREENCAP OR LINK TO OTHER SUBS OR USERS. Twitter or other non-Reddit media screencaps are fine, but please remove the names. Posting screencaps from other subs carries a two month ban, with no negotiation.\n2. Circlejerks are jokes at the expense of prevailing opinion. Anything else is banned, because it isn\u2019t a circlejerk. Memes can be reflective of a circlejerk, but you should use a title that adds to it. Reposting popular meta accounts (\u201cBuryingSmarks\u201d et al) wholesale will result in bans. Non-circlejerk meme content will be removed and repeat offenders banned at the moderation team's discretion.\n3. All Non-Circlejerk content is prohibited. This includes: \"Unjerk\" posts, complaining about r/SquaredCircle, posting news, asking for help with bans, screencaps of twitter or youtube comments you don't like with no commentary - no thanks. Post will be tagged with \"not a circlejerk\" or \"Rule 3\" and posters will be banned for up to 30 days.\n4. Don\u2019t be a dick. Starting fights with other users, or participating in them, is bannable. If you\u2019re thinking of being a dick \u2013 don\u2019t. It\u2019s a wrestling circlejerk forum. It's literally the least important thing on earth.\n5. No edgelords. Homophobia, racism, transphobia and the rest has never been welcome here, nor will they ever be. Posts that fall into this category are subject to removal without notice and the users banned, usually permanently.\n6. Low effort rule: Reposts, lazy karma grabs, vague titles, reposting popular accounts will all be removed and repeat offenders banned for as long as we feel like. This sub is funny from people here, not elsewhere. If you\u2019re just posting other people\u2019s stuff, don\u2019t bother.\n7. All other aspects of Reddit's sitewide rules apply.\nHaving trouble getting over? Read our wiki before posting.\nArguing with the mods over bans usually results in the ban being doubled. Arguing again after a warning usually results in a permaban. The ban is the warning. It's a reddit shitposting sub, you can cope with some time off."}, {"header": "ANNOUNCEMENTS", "description": "None yet."}]}, "Wallstreetbetsnew": {"time_collected": "2023-03-06 23:23:19.232951-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "The Ultimate Free Course for Options Trading", "time_posted": "7 days ago"}, {"heading": "Top Earnings Trades For March 06 2023 - Two trades on the radar for today", "time_posted": "12 hours ago"}, {"heading": "J.P.

(unofficial)\nRules of /r/Knife_Swap:\n1. Ignorance of the rules is not a valid defense against rule breaking.\n2. Until you have Trader flair, you may only post one knife at a time for sale or trade. This does not mean you can post multiple threads, each with one knife. Sellers with flair may list as many knives as they want in a single post, but please keep it to one post- exorbitant listing spam will be removed. Also remember, Moderators hold little control over bad deals, there IS a risk if you are dealing with a first time trader. Be cautious. If a trade goes bad, message us with what happened and proof. Click the little envelope by the list of the moderators to message modmail. Additionally, please do not post [META] posts without mod approval.\n3. Every post requires a TIMESTAMP to show the items are in your possession, which is at least one photo of any item(s) that you are posting, with something with your reddit username (or other explicitly identifiable identification, like a date tattoo) and the **CURRENT date handwritten (not digital)** and shows any visible problems with the item(s). Please try to use detailed pictures showing any wear, but also note that your description carries more weight than pictures. BE ACCURATE when describing your knives. You must have at least one picture of the knife open so the blade is visible.\n4. Format the title of your post along the lines of [WTT] (Trade), [WTS] (Sell), Make and Model of Knives you are selling- as an example, [WTS] Hinderer XM-18 3.0 Spanto, Quietcarry Waypoint.\nEvery post requires a detailed description. Failure to adequately describe your knife will result in mandatory partial or full refunds. A detailed description should include, at a minimum, if it's been sharpened, if it's dull/chipped, approximate number of owners, centering/lockup, scratches/snails, if it comes with the box/papers/accessories that one could reasonably expect from the factory, mods, etc... We cannot emphasize this enough. Here's an easy template you can copy and paste into your post:\nEdge Condition: Factory/Sharpened (by who)/any edge damage like chips/currently sharp or dull\nOwnership: First/Second/Unknown (At least Second)\nCentering/Lockup: PICTURES, lockup percentage, centering\nBody Condition: PICTURES, snail trails, scratches, screw damage, loctite\nBox, papers, and accessories: Do you have everything that normally comes with it, e.g. a COA, CRK cloth, extra hardware, lanyard tube with lanyard? Or what's missing?\nModifications: None/Reversible/Irreversible/Anodization\nDisassembled: Never/Yes/by someone else\nAll WTS posts should have a price. All WTT posts should list what they're looking for and an approximate trade value.\nUsers under 25 flair MUST use Paypal Goods & Services for their sales. Users OVER 25 flair MAY request payment via any other platform. Buyers do not need to be over 25 flair to PAY via other non-G&S methods. However, if you do not feel comfortable paying non G&S, that is your prerogative, though you may lose out on the purchase. Users under 25 flair found to be requesting non-G&S methods will receive temporary bans as punishment. Please report any users requesting non-G&S under 25 flair.\nThe COST OF SHIPPING is the responsibility of each shipper (it must be included in the price of the item listed), unless agreed upon by both parties. This means you are responsible for anything you ship until it is received by the buyer, unless agreed upon otherwise. International users assume liability unless stated otherwise. It\u2019s for these reasons we HIGHLY encourage the use of shipping insurance.\nOnce a sale is complete, it is mandatory to leave the prices listed in the post.\nDO NOT DELETE POSTS. There is a 10 minute grace period- if the post is up longer than 10 minutes it is against the rules to delete it. If you have a typo in the title, you can delete (as long as it\u2019s within 10 minutes) and repost. If the post is live more than 10 minutes, any changes will need to be made in the body of the post. (Mods can not edit titles)\nWhen you complete (all items are delivered) a trade, sale, or purchase, be sure to use the confirmed transaction bot to get your appropriate flair. Click here to learn more.\n5. Do not ask exorbitant prices for a knife. All knives here are technically used, we do not recommend asking MSRP or a price where it will be cheaper elsewhere. YOU WILL BE CALLED OUT ON THIS BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY! That said, please do not dogpile somebody over this. Be respectful, follow the golden rule. This rule ties heavily into rule eight!\n6. When you post a knife and it does not sell (or get traded) and you wish to repost it, you must reduce the price (or trade value) by 10% or $25, at the seller's discretion. If you would like to repost your knife for the same price (without reduction), you may only post it again after one week. NEW USERS, if you post a knife that doesn\u2019t sell you may post it again with a price reduction (stated above) OR you can wait five days and post a different knife penalty free.\n7. Sales must be at least half knives (or explicitly knife-related goods like pocket clips or scales) in both total post value and number. One to one ratio of knives to gear is the maximum. Total value of the gear cannot be higher in value than the value of the knives. Clear attempts to circumvent (a kershaw leek for $500 and a pen) will be removed and the OP will receive a temp ban for attempting to circumvent the rules. Knife-related items include things like sharpening equipment, scales, pocket clips, hardware, or bearings aka stuff that is only used on knives. Lanyards, beads, and similar things are not considered exclusively knife-related. Bundles count as the number of items in the bundle, not as one \"item\". Use /r/EDCexchange for your gear!\n8.
