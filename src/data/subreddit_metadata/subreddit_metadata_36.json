You can use both English and Vietnamese here.\nLow effort submissions. Off-topic and low-effort submissions (memes) will be removed at the moderators' discretion.\nPost your general/travel/visa questions in the sticky thread for questions. Unless your question's intention is to create a discussion, keep it to the sticky questions thread. Most travel/visa questions should be kept there also. Please don't post your questions outside of this thread as they will be removed.\nBe civil. This means no racism / homophobia / xenophobia / sexism / hatemongering / harassment / personal attacks on other users. Seriously we shouldn't have to explain this. It's okay to discuss controversial topics, you can argue, and you can get into heated disagreements, but don't cross the line. Discrimination due to gender, race, national origin, religion, etc. will not be tolerated and is a bannable offense. No questions asked. Also no doxxing please. Do not post or seek any real or fake personal information (examples include: full names, phone numbers, email addresses, or social media accounts). Shaming or compromising pics must be anonymized.\nAvoid posting more than 2 posts per day. No flooding of posts. In order to prevent any user from flooding the subreddit, excessively (more than two in 24 hours) posting is prohibited. Spamming posts that don't provide sufficient and additional information may lead to a 30-day ban on the poster. Posts will be removed at the moderator's discretion.\nNo spam or self promotion. Including spamming your opinions. Don't do that. Submissions violating the spirit of Reddit's self promotion guidelines will be removed. As a general rule, we usually do not allow travel blogs/vlogs as they are almost always posted in violation of these guidelines.\nPosts & comments should be on-topic. Posts & comments should be about news, culture, people, and life in Vietnam. Basically anything Vietnam related. Posts may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Vietnam. Comments also need to stay on topic. For example, don't hijack a highly-upvoted food photo post with unrelated political conversations.\nDon't editorialize news posts. When linking to news articles, please use the original title, or a straightforward and accurate one of your own. Editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, and/or misleading titles may result in the removal of the post. If you have an opinion about the article you are submitting, please post it in the comments instead.\nDon't post content or ask questions about illegal things. Drugs, prostitution, etc., are not allowed.\nNo Political Discussion Political Discussion should be posted on r/VietNamPolitics\nMeme Monday. Memes should only be posted on Mondays.

If the top mod of a subreddit you moderate is still active on the site, please use this process instead.\nIf you're looking for some inspiration or are new to moderating and would like some experience, check out our new wiki which lists a huge amount of subreddits that are currently unmoderated and available for request.\nPlease read before posting\nRequesters:\nYour account must be at least 90 days old and have at least 500 post/comment karma to request a subreddit. Awarder and awardee karma do not count towards this total.\nAutomod will respond to every request, but sometimes a request will be missed by the bot. If there is no message after a couple of days, it has automatically been moved to manual review. Please do not delete your request if there is no comment.\nWhen a request is made, an automatic message will be sent to the mods of that sub asking them to respond to the request. We allow a 5 day grace period for moderators of requested subreddits to receive and respond to this message. This timeframe should not be taken as an indication of when you can expect a response to your request.\nModerators:\nIf you already mod a subreddit whose top moderator is inactive across Reddit and wish to remove your top mod, post a link to your subreddit and put the name of the mod you\u2019re wanting to remove in the subject line.\nIf you already moderate a subreddit that has a top moderator who is inactive in your subreddit but active elsewhere on Reddit, you will need to use the top mod removal process here.\nIf you are already the moderator of a subreddit that was banned due to lack of moderation and would like to appeal that ban, please contact r/modsupport via modmail instead of r/redditrequest.\nTo be considered an active mod, you must be actively moderating your subreddit.\nIf there has been no activity on your account in the last 30 days, you will be considered inactive. Solely logging in does not count as activity.\nWhen a request has been made, you will receive a message from request_bot linking you to the modmail message from the user who is requesting the subreddit.\nIf you would like to continue moderating this subreddit you must reply in the comments of the request within 5 days. Failure to do so will result in the subreddit being eligible for reddit request.\nYou must have valid reasons when denying the request and explain to the requester and us why you want to keep the subreddit. We want to ensure that subreddits are being held onto with the right intentions for growth. Responding to requests will decrease the number of people who believe the subreddit is unmoderated. Please note that responding with a simple \"no\" is not considered a valid reason.\nIf you would like to add the mod to your team you can find instructions on how to do that here.\nRules\nYou may only request one subreddit every 15 days. Choose wisely. Multiple requests will be auto removed.\nIf a subreddit has been banned in the last 30 days and has over 2.5K subscribers, it is not eligible for request and will be denied. Anything under 2.5K will be reviewed in the normal timeframe.\nAccounts less than 90 days old and without at least 500 combined post/comment karma will not be approved subreddits.\nYou may not use multiple accounts to request subreddits.\nYou may not request subreddits on behalf of other users.\nBefore requesting a subreddit, you must send a message to the subreddit\u2019s modmail stating your intentions for the subreddit. Please link to this message in your post. Failure to do so will result in a denial. Exceptions will be made to this rule if the sub is banned, private, or there are no mods listed.\nThe exact criteria used in evaluating requests is left to admin discretion but can include, sitewide bans in the last 90 days, not having enough mod experience, no relevant karma for the requested subreddit or if the majority of your karma is from freekarma subs etc. More info can be found in our FAQ.\nMultiple people can request the same subreddit, though requests are reviewed in a chronological order. If you are receiving an error when requesting a subreddit that has already been requested please refer to the FAQ.\nPlease do not ask for an exemption from the rules.\nRequests can take up to 4 weeks to be reviewed, so please be patient.\nAdditional information may be found in the FAQ\nThis is an admin-sponsored subreddit."}]}, "Gamecube": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 15:26:28.557275-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Weekly /r/Gamecube Discussion (December 27, 2020) - What have you been playing, and what do you think of it?", "time_posted": "2 years ago"}, {"heading": "For inquisitive users wondering how much they can get their games for:", "time_posted": "1 year ago"}, {"heading": "What have you been playing recently ?

This is a voice and text chatroom, with weekly open study and discussion groups. NOTE: The moderation team of the discord is distinct from the moderation team of this subreddit Thus, the /r/Occult mods have neither the authority nor the ability (and likely not the inclination) to unban you from the Discord Please don't ask.\nWiki\nThe /r/Occult wiki contains FAQs, educational resources, and more.\nGuidelines\nThis subreddit seeks to create an environment for the respectful debate and discussion of occult philosophy and metaphysics.\nReview the FAQ before posting. Specific questions are always welcome, but any post relating to these topics will be removed.\nAny posts pertaining to conspiracy theories, the NWO, the Illuminati, 9/11, or related topics will be removed. Try /r/Conspiracy or /r/OccultConspiracy.\nIf you want to post commercial links, links to your YouTube channels, and links to your Etsy store, we ask that you keep these to no more than 2x a month. We are trying to avoid the use of /r/Occult solely to promote goods or services. You must also post a comment explaining the work, what it symbolizes, etc. Commercial posts without a contributing comment from the author will be removed.\nThe primary purpose of /r/Occult is discussion. Posts that are just images with no other context or explanation for why you found it worth sharing, occult memes/comics are not welcome. Other subreddits exist for these purposes (/r/OccultArt, /r/OccultMemes). Please no Instagram links.\nBigotry, racism, homophobia, and all threats physical or other will not be tolerated. Follow the Golden Rule.\nCheck your Magus-itis at the door.\nSpamming and trolling of any variety will not be tolerated.\nPosting occult-related work/crafts is tolerated. However, accounts that solely or continuously self-promote are subject to bans. Again, please keep this to no more than twice a month. Consider other subs like /r/OccultArt or /r/OccultMemes for such posts.\nPosts and comments made from accounts with negative karma, or posts containing \"suspicious\" links, will be auto-removed. If your post is legitimate, please message the mods.\nPosts that violate these guidelines may be removed at admin/moderator discretion. Repeat offenders and trolls will be banned.\nIf there is a problem, please report the post or comment to the mods.\nFAQs\nHow to Do Magic\nIllustrated Beginners Guide to Chaos Magic\nOccultism 101: The Basics\nOccultism 101: Types of Occultism Pt. 1\nWhere Do I Start?\nLearn 2 Magick for free\nOfficial Anthem\nPentagram Sam\nRelated Subreddits\n/r/Altars\n/r/Alchemy\n/r/Alexandria\n/r/Animism\n/r/AskAstrologers\n/r/AskOccult\n/r/AstralArmy\n/r/Astrology\n/r/AstrologyMemes\n/r/BlackMagic\n/r/BOTA\n/r/ChaosMagicians\n/r/ChaosMagick\n/r/ChristianOccultism\n/r/ConsultTheTarot\n/r/Cyberdelinaut\n/r/DarkGnosis\n/r/DemonolatryPractices\n/r/Demons\n/r/DimensionalJumping\n/r/Discordian\n/r/Divination\n/r/DreamInterpretation\n/r/Dreams\n/r/Druidism\n/r/Echerdex\n/r/ElderWitches\n/r/Energy_Manipulation\n/r/Energy_Work\n/r/Enochian\n/r/Esoterica\n/r/EsotericChristianity\n/r/Esotericism\n/r/GameArcane\n/r/Geomancy\n/r/Gnostic\n/r/Gnosticism\n/r/GoldenDawnMagicians\n/r/Grimoires\n/r/Heathenry\n/r/HellsomeMemes\n/r/Herbalism\n/r/Herblore\n/r/Hermeticism\n/r/Hermetics\n/r/HolySummoners\n/r/IChing\n/r/JewishKabbalah\n/r/Jung\n/r/Kybalion\n/r/LeftHandPath\n/r/Magick\n/r/MagicUsers\n/r/Mediums\n/r/Mysticism\n/r/NeoPagan\n/r/Numerology\n/r/Occult_Art\n/r/OccultConspiracy\n/r/OccultCord\n/r/Occult_Music\n/r/OccultMemes\n/r/OccultPoetry\n/r/OccultTrade\n/r/Occult_R4R\n/r/PaganArt\n/r/PaganCraftExchange\n/r/PaganFestivals\n/r/Paganism\n/r/PaganMarketplace\n/r/PaganMemes\n/r/PaganMusic\n/r/PaganPenPals\n/r/PaganR4R\n/r/PaganStudies\n/r/Paranormal\n/r/ParanormalScience\n/r/PastLives\n/r/Precognition\n/r/Psychonaut\n/r/Psychic\n/r/Qabalah\n/r/Quareia\n/r/Randonauts\n/r/Reiki\n/r/Runecasting\n/r/Runes\n/r/SatanicArt\n/r/SatanicGaming\n/r/SatanicLiterature\n/r/Satanic_Memes\n/r/SatanicMusic\n/r/SatanicProse\n/r/SatanicTemple_Reddit\n/r/Satanism\n/r/Satanists\n/r/Setianism\n/r/Shamanism\n/r/Sigils\n/r/SolitaryWicca\n/r/SorceryOfTheSpectacle\n/r/Spiritual\n/r/Symbology\n/r/Tarot\n/r/Tarots\n/r/Technomancy\n/r/Telekinesis\n/r/Thelema\n/r/TheMysterySchool\n/r/TheoryOfAstrology\n/r/Theosophy\n/r/TraditionalWicca\n/r/Tulpas\n/r/Vodou\n/r/VRMysterySchool\n/r/Wicca\n/r/Witchcraft\n/r/Witch_House\n/r/Witchy_Things\n/r/Zodiac\n/r/ZodiacArt\n(If you'd like a subreddit added to the sidebar, feel free to message the mods here)"}]}, "EntExchange": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 15:31:33.920499-05:00", "top_headers": [], "subreddits": {}, "about": {}, "other_information": []}, "Hairloss": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 15:31:41.867406-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Hair Loss: Causes, Treatments, What to avoid & What to look for.", "time_posted": "2 years ago"}, {"heading": "My attempt at a FAQ for Dutasteride (a little about oral/topical Finasteride as well..)", "time_posted": "3 months ago"}, {"heading": "M20, is this MPB?

Neville Lancelot Goddard was a spiritual teacher and author from Barbados, widely regarded as one of the most influential New Thought and Law of Attraction teachers.

He taught the Bible as an allegorical picture of the imaginal act.\nHe believed that human imagination is the only God and a person can achieve anything by imagining the wish fulfilled.\n  Neville's Brief Biography\n  New to Neville?\nBefore posting, we ask that you familiarize yourself with Neville's teachings.
