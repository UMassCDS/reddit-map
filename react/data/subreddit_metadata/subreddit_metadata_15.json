TopMindsOfReddit is a subreddit for chronicling the adventures of Reddit's boldest truth seekers in their quest to awaken the obsequious masses. While /r/conspiracy is the natural place to observe expert investigators hard at work exposing The Truth, links to comments and threads anywhere on Reddit are welcome.\nExpanded Rules From Old Reddit\nThou shalt not vote or comment in linked threads or comments, and in linked threads or comments, thou shalt not vote or comment. It's bad form, and the admins will shadowban your account if they catch you.\nModerators can remove links, posts or comments and ban users at their discretion. Their word is not final and can be appealed, don't be rude about appealing though.\nAny spamming or abuse of the mod mail will be reported to the admins. So don't bother.\nPosts must directly involve a conspiracy theory, conspiracy theorists, general topmindery, or denial of objective reality on Reddit. Posts about general racism, sexism, or other bigotry are better suited for subreddits such as /r/isrconspiracyracist, /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, /r/openbroke, /r/worstof, or /r/ShitRedditSays.\nAgitated conspiracy wingnuts will only be allowed if they are entertaining. This rule will be enforced arbitrarily and without warning.\nExcessive retroactive editing of your posts is frowned upon. Especially if used to shift the goalposts. This entirely depends on how entertaining you are.\nGot a sweet piece of proof that alien Elvis was chummy with Mugatu? Link it directly - traffic whoring will get you banned.\nSlurs and hate speech will earn you a one way ticket to Bansville.\nWe also might ban you just because we feel like it. Bansville is nice this time of year.\nExcessive username pinging is strictly prohibited. Any user caught violating this rule will be warned. If the user doesn't adhere to the warning then they will be banned. Please report any instances of excessive username pinging.\nRelated Subs\n/r/Qult_headquarters (new!): Here we chronicle the 4D chess of our favorite Deep State 4channer, Q Anon.\n/r/vaxxhappened: 100% True Stories from the Anti-vaxx Crowd.\n/r/isrconspiracyracist: /r/yesyesitis\n/r/PanicHistory: Predictions of impending doom, and commentary on life in the American police state.\n/r/actualconspiracies: Real conspiracies.

Post a link to your portfolio with a general idea of your pricing structure! Be sure to subscribe to the sub and check daily for new requests.\nWhat are the rules?\nWe don't have many, and most of them are common sense!\nIf you have any issues, please message our Moderators!\nRule 1. Commissioning art\nIf you are commissioning a piece, please include [Hiring] at the start of your post. You MUST provide a budget IN USD for how much you would be willing to pay for your artwork. If you\u2019re not sure of the specific number, give a rough estimate of your budget.\nPlease be as specific as possible with your listing and provide as much useful information as possible about the specs of the project, including size, purpose, media, and deadline.\nWhen you have found your artist, please comment on your post - ' Position Filled ' to announce that you are no longer looking. This will also lock your thread.\nRule 2. Payment and Pricing\nWe discourage any budgets or prices that are under $30 per piece. After July 30th, 2022, prices under $30 will no longer be allowed.\nIf you are purchasing a piece that requires commercial rights, the minimum is $100 USD - With that, we will also require that if you are looking for (Work For Hire) WFH / Full rights transfer of a commercial piece, the price should reflect that. On average, the cost of a full rights transfer is 200-300% of the creation cost. Our recommended industry entry level standard is $500 per piece to take over full ownership of the image. Anyone asking for full rights below that rate will be removed.\nPlease use a payment processor that has buyer and seller protection with the ability to include terms and conditions, a contract, and escrow or refund options. PayPal Business / \"Goods and services\" options are the most common. There is NO reason to use a 'friends and family' money transfer with a stranger online. It's typical for the client to cover any payment fees or for the artist to include them in their pricing.\nContracts are STRONGLY recommended for additional protection of both artist and client. Every single time without question you should have a contract, no matter what.\nIf you have concerns with a transaction, report it to the moderators for investigation.\nAll \u201cbitcoin\u201d currencies are banned and will only be allowing \u2018fiat money\u2019 or stable currency from now on. No gift cards, stocks, weird e-check scams, or fortnight points and so on. Artists should be able to pay all of their bills with the money they earn off the /r/HungryArtists subreddit. ALL NFT PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED - If you are purchasing the digital publishing rights or NFT rights of a piece of artwork , that is a different discussion that both parties should agree to and be paid for. Payment in NFTs, percentages, or coins does not count as payment under rule 2\nRule 3. SPEC work\nFree work is not allowed.\nDo NOT ask for artists to create any amount of work before agreeing to payment and hiring the artist. Every artist hired must receive payment or the project will be considered as speculative work\nCompetitions are not allowed. No 5-minute sketch samples. No unpaid 'tests'. No investment opportunities. No \"I'll pay you when this gets funded\".\nPlease report anyone seen asking for, offering, or making free artwork in an attempt to get the job.\nRule 4. Artist Portfolios\nArtists, please include [For Hire] at the start of your post. Try to include price and image examples. Be clear on your ability to ship and shipping costs if applicable.\nYour portfolio must not require login/account creation. Any kind of store page are not allowed on this subreddit. Post on /r/artstore instead.\nArtists, while commenting, please do not attempt to undercut each other in the community. The client picked their budget for a reason and with an expectation of a quality that matches that budget or higher. We are a marketplace where price is flexible but going lower is never the answer.\nRule 5. Spam\nYou will be warned and subsequently banned if caught doing these spam offences frequently:\nPosting portfolios with no correlation to clients request, eg, the client asked for an oil painting and your portfolio is 100% logo design.\nPosting the same copy-pasted response to client requests. Personalise and acknowledge you actually read the request.\nLinking to sites that require an account.\nIf you see spam or have concerns with a transaction report it to the mods for investigation.\nRule 6. Posting Limits\nDo not make more than one post per week . This ONLY applies to artists' FOR HIRE posts.\nDeletion of posts is discouraged for recordkeeping purposes. If there is a need, the mods can lock a post upon request.\nRule 7. Supportive and professional conduct\nBe supportive and professional. If someone is doing something wrong or needs some help, politely let them know, in PM if necessary. Comments negatively criticising art portfolios openly will be banned.\nNo matter the user, please don't create a hostile environment by insulting or cursing. We expect everyone to be professional and use common courtesy. Use the report button and let us handle issues. Continual hostile activity will result in a ban from the sub.\nRule 8. Art Theft\nArt theft will be tolerated under NO circumstances. Do not steal other's work or IP to copy or profit from. The client has a responsibility to make sure their reference images are legal to use for their commission. Artist Credit must be given where it is due, but is not seen as a valid form of payment.\nAs always, rules are up to moderator discretion, so if someone is being an ass, they may see consequences even if they're just toeing the line.\nIf you do not see your post\nPlease note that if you have a relatively new account or very low comment karma(<25), your posts will be caught in the spam filter- IF you have OVER 25 Karma and are still having issues please message the moderators to have your post reviewed. No posts under 25 karma will be approved. This is a preventive spam measure for people who have no interest in participating in our community.\nPosts containing shortened URLs (such as bitly and so on) will be automatically removed.\nHelpful Links\nDiscord Server\nNoSpec!\nSubreddit friend that's great for posting shops /r/artstore\nIf you have hired someone through this subreddit please leave a review over on /r/HungryArtistsFed\nArt Credits\nHeader Image(from left to right):\nArtists of our new banner:\n/u/Baconstrap - portfolio - image\n/u/Lorpo314 - image\n/u/RutujaPadwal - image\n/u/Yes-Sarasly - image\nAmy-Rose Art & Design - image\n/u/Jordanrace - image\n/u/Xensoldier - image\nArtisticChaos - image\n/u/Yoomookun submitted - image\n/u/mmmichelle -image\n/u/Diamdesign - image\n/u/Dainius8888 - portfolio - image\nSidebar Image: /u/WaarIsDeSol - portfolio - image Updated 7/30/2022"}]}, "animememes": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 02:13:23.505383-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "A video explaining the history of the t-word and why it\u2019s a slur will be linked below, along with more information on the subreddit\u2019s policies.

Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of a state or ruler, society would improve itself through empowering individual choice and the discipline of the free market, or what its proponents describe as a voluntary society.\nRacism and Social Justice are considered off-topic here; libertarianism does not have a racial component.

(If you do use Imgur, DO NOT click the green \"Share to Community\" button. Doing so will allow unwanted Imgur users separate from Reddit to view and comment on your album. You don't want that!)\nIn your post, tell us a little bit about yourself. You can also add a comment to your post if you're looking for something in particular.\nTry providing a clear, representative picture of yourself (or several). Extreme closeups and crazy filtered pictures will not produce reliable ratings for you.\nWhat you consider your \u201cgood picture\u201d might be less attractive to others, and what you think looks terrible might actually be flattering. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Ratings are subjective! Personal tastes vary widely.\nDon't trust anyone who private messages you as a result of your post, especially with a proposition involving money. Be cautious with anybody who solicits additional pictures from you. Report all suspected scammers to Reddit by using the message report tool.\nAll posts on r/RateMe are manually approved by a moderator. To help us get through posts faster and increase your chances of being approved, please ensure that your verification photo is LEGIBLE. Tight cursive on crumpled graph paper in pencil obscured by your hand is unlikely to be sufficient. Please keep in mind that services like PicCollage may compress images and reduce image resolution. Submitting an illegible verification photo will either delay your post's approval or lead to your post being rejected.
