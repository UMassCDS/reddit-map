Mark your spoiler in posts and comments using the official Reddit spoiler tags: >!Spoiler Text Here!< = Spoiler Text Here\nFull spoiler policy\nDon't post porn or exposed genitalia. These posts will be removed. Meme formats from porn are okay if the NSFW areas are appropriately covered. If in doubt, mark anyway. See reddit's Broadcasting Content Policy for more info.\nNo bullying, derogatory, offensive, non-Cosmere politics, non-Cosmere religion, racist, inciting, or otherwise outlandishly crude material allowed in posts or comments. Being belligerent falls under this category.\nEvery post that is blasphemous in the eye of Vorinism must be tagged so. This can be done using reddits so called NSFW function to stamp your post with a 'NSFV' tag. This rule especially encompasses uncovered safehands.\nIf the meme contains a format that includes politics but doesn't demean in any way then it is okay. Meme 1: Kelsier saying \"Thank you, Vin, very cool!\" in reference to the Kanye/Trump tweets is fine. Meme 2: The Lord Ruler as Trump and the joke is that they are the same person due to the poster's belief Trump is a tyrant is not fine. Another example is r/Breath_of_the_Wild's ruling, which I would high recommend reading. No Trump talk. Those conversations don't belong here.\nMod rulings are final. The mods will hear out any case, but in the end the mods' rulings are considered final.\nNo spoilers in titles. If you have a spoiler in the title it will be removed even if the post is marked as spoiler.\nNo fantasy sub politics (ex. whitecloakposting). No posting about politics/ethics/opinions about Wheel of Time or other fantasy shows/books \"problems\". Those discussion belong on the their appropriate subreddits.\nDon't post banned memes. Look at our wiki to see which memes are banned.\nObey reddiquette.\nPosts must be on topic. Posts must be related or reference Brandon Sanderson's works in some capacity.\nFirst time violation of these rules will result in a message from moderators. Second time will be another message. Third time will be a ban.
