Notice that if you have received any gifts, CIG will refund you only up to the amount you have spent yourself.\nRequest a full refund via email or use this form. Be polite but firm. Include your RSI account name and the expected refund amount. Give them a firm deadline, two weeks is fine. This step is mostly a formality at this point to create a paper trail.\nYou may receive an email telling that your refund is being escalated to the refund specialist. This is a stalling tactic, there is no specialist. If you wish to reply, simple \"I would like to proceed with my refund\" will do.\nAfter the deadline has passed, contact your bank and initiate a chargeback process. If you paid with Paypal, open a dispute.\nFile a formal complaint with your local consumer protection authorities.
