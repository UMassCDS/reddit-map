A victim of gangstalking can have their reputation, credibility, careers, relationships and entire life put into ruins.\nTechniques such as mind games, perception manipulation, organized stalking, covert harassment, constant surveillance and possibly electronic harassment are used to push a victim to mental instability.\nProving one\u2019s targeting can be very challenging, and there is very little law enforcement support, which allows gangstalking to be extremely effective.\nContemplating Suicide?\nCall the National Suicide Prevention Hotline! 800-273-8255 or for non US location check: Wikipedia Suicide Crisis Lines or see r/suicidewatch\nRules of /r/gangstalking:\nNo trolling, spamming, or name calling.\nPlease keep all submissions and comments on topic. This also means to respond specifically to someone's comment when replying to them.\nDo not accuse mental illness. Do not give specific medical advice to strangers, especially to start or stop taking prescriptions. If you legitimately think someone has a serious issue message the mods here to make a claim.\nNo witch-hunting or sharing of others personal information. You may feel the need to share who you feel is perping you. However this is not the place. Witch-hunting is not tolerated. Not only is this a violation of Reddit's rules, but also this sub's.\nFollow Redditquette.\nContent Guidelines:\nPlease keep all content relevant to gangstalking and targeted individuals.\nIf linking to a blog, forum, or video, please no more than two posts per day from the blog, forum, or video uploader.

If you're a skeptic and contribute with a negative approach, you probably will get flamed. There is already too much trolling and disinformation to argue one's skepticism of all gangstalking. The mods attempt to flair troublesome users as a warning, so please use an app that shows flairs.\nIf you're looking for a stalking support group, this may not be the sub for you. You will be faced with trolls, hackers, and fake victims. If you contribute, know that you are posting in a sub that is filled with cyber-stalkers and people being cyber-stalked.
