This can mean, for example, close up photos of a part as well as photos from farther back, and/or different angles, which give significant context.\nIf there is a part number or a model number on something you suspect or know to be at issue definitely include that.\nA description of the event(s) or circumstances that lead up to or were present at the time the issue arose.\nSafety\nThere are things that are too dangerous for us to handle here.
