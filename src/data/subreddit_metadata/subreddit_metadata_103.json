We are interested in re-investing Christianity with its transgressive elements, and as such we are openly against oppressive discourses (sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, speciesism, ableism, colonialism, imperialism).\nWe are interested in exploring both philosophical and theological thought and action. The definitions of \"radical\" and \"Christianity\" each carry a certain denotative vagueness while still retaining enough connotative force to be a mostly accurate descriptor of who we are as a group.\nMany of us find our beliefs marked by a certain desire for disassociation with and transgression against conventional Christian institutions and culture. We support divergent forms of thinking.\nWe find that group discussion is desirable and important. Viewpoints that may initially seem odd or shocking are often filled with critical insights and viable possibilities of being that a cursory dismissal would otherwise overlook. Fascists/Nazis/Nazbols will be banned on sight.\nIf you need anything, or your post has been caught in the spam filter, please message the mods.
