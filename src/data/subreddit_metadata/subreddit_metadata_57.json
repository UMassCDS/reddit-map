Use flair to mark the language of your post instead.\nDo post code snippets only. If you want to share the context put it in the comments or title.\nDo stay lighthearted. No abusive or targeted posts. We all write bad code, and a lot of it is hilarious.\nDo not identify who wrote the code. This sub is about bad code, not the people who write it.
