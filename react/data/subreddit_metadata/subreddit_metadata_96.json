It shares the values that this sub expresses. If you are new to or just starting out with energy work, this is the book you want to read.\nThe Energy Cure by William Bengston. If you are a skeptic and looking for scientific proof that energy heals, pick up this book. It includes overviews of research in which mice with aggressive breast cancer genes were cured in full with only healing energy from hands.\nAdventures Beyond the Body by William Buhlman. A howto book for out-of-body exploration.\nInstant Rapport by Michael Brooks. Rapport is a weak and fragile type of energetic connection, but it is a good starting place for learning how to extend your energy beyond your own body. This book is a very interesting read and a great place to start.\nGut and Psychology Syndrome by Natasha Campbell-McBride. A toxic gut microbiome is probably the most overlooked cause of disease world-wide. This book looks at effects of a toxic gut on mental health. It gives a fantastic layman's overview of how everything works. This is a must read for anyone in this sub dealing with chronic or autoimmune diseases or mental health issues.\nThe Cosmic Serpent by Jeremy Narby. It focuses a lot on the double helix/double snake symbolism, but the author spends time with the Aboriginals of the Amazon and goes into detail about the relationship between the ancients and plant life. He notes their communication with plants through hallucinatory states/higher levels of consciousness, and how the plants would pass the knowledge of their uses onto the humans.\nLife Rules by Yehuda Berg. An easy read on the nature of reality from the viewpoint of the kabbalah written for the layperson. Effective energy work requires an understanding of reality that is not taught in schools.\nThe Essence of Reality by Thomas Daniel Nehrer. Another mind expanding treatment of reality from the author's perspective.

When referencing a post or comment, please provide a link or explain why you cannot (for example, a removed comment written by someone else - if you wrote it yourself and it was removed, you should still be able to link to it).\nIII. All posts should include either a question or a call for action from the mods (for example, \"Why was this comment removed?\" or \"Add a userpinger group about...\").\nEXPECTATIONS\nIf your post can be easily responded to by any mod, you can expect a response within 36 hours. After that point, feel free to re-tag moderators and/or PM a moderator to make them aware of the lack of response. Understand that when this happens, it is likely the result of logistical issues rather than any malevolence on our part.\nIf your post likely needs mod deliberation for an answer, needs a specific mod to respond, or needs a mod with technical expertise to respond, then you can expect a response within 48 hours. After that point, feel free to re-tag moderators and/or PM a moderator to make them aware of the lack of response. Again, please assume good intentions on our part in this situation.\nWhile we do not require your complaints to be polite, understand that phrasing your criticism and complaints in a constructive manner is more likely to get you a quick and helpful response.\nFinally, our intention is not for posts in this sub to be ignored.
