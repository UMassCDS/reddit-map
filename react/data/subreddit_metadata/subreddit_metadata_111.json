Every year a ton of new fans start on the show and books, and there are few places on the Internet where they can talk about them safely. This community is meant to be a place for both new and old fans.\nSpoilers are moderated, and users who are careless with spoilers get banned. Don't make hints or jokes with spoilers in no-spoilers threads. Usernames that include a spoiler are also banned; it doesn't matter how cool they are or how funny the joke is.\nPlease note that references to IMDB or similar sources to prove a character will be present or not are not allowed.\nIf your submission concerns (or illustrates) a spoiler, click the \"spoiler\" tag after you submit your post. Keep in mind that titles can't contain spoilers, thumbnails can't contain spoilers, and the combination of the two can't equal a spoiler.\nEpisode previews are treated as spoilers, and should not be discussed in the official episode discussion threads without proper use of comment spoiler tags.\nYou should assume the comments section of any thread contains untagged spoilers up to the latest officially aired episode, unless the title implies or states a scope, e.g. \"Just started episode 1, I have a question\" - do not post episode 2 spoilers without tags in that thread.\nComment spoiler tag format: >!Spoiler!< becomes Spoiler. Replace \"spoiler\" with your desired text.\nEverything in the graphic novels is considered a spoiler.\nNo spoiler tags are needed for discussion of the movie."}]}, "MarioMaker2": {"time_collected": "2023-03-20 17:27:04.670659-04:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Daily Level and Super World Exchange/Feedback for Feedback Thread", "time_posted": "1 year ago"}, {"heading": "7MMC Week 2: The Happy Isles", "time_posted": "6 months ago"}, {"heading": "How do you keep enemies in a certain area?", "time_posted": "18 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Does anyone know how this creator spawned Peepas like this?", "time_posted": "1 day ago"}, {"heading": "Try my courses (easy medium and hard)", "time_posted": "20 hours ago"}, {"heading": "Question about Meowser", "time_posted": "2 days ago"}, {"heading": "Altrive Plays Minecraft the Way Home", "time_posted": "3 days ago"}, {"heading": "Does no one play online anymore?", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}, {"heading": "Thwomp's Taxi Service 2", "time_posted": "4 days ago"}], "rules": ["Post really cool info about mariomaker2.", "Check out Level of the Week threads for upcoming sub contests!", "Be excellent to each other.", "Salty posts, memes, or offtopic content (including smm1) will be removed.", "Levels/Super Worlds: Please post in stickied threads.
