Often (but not always) a verbal or visual pun, if it elicited a snort or face palm - then our community is ready to groan along with you.\nTo be clear, dad status is not a requirement. We're all different, we're all excellent. Some people are born with lame jokes in their heart and so here, everyone is a dad. Some dads are wholesome, some are not. It's about how the joke is delivered more than anything.\nSome dads are wholesome and clean, others have a bit of raunch to them. It's not about the content or the age of the person hearing the joke... it's about how it's delivered. Bonus points for sticking to the classic stereotypes of being opportunistic and punny.\nThat said, dad jokes are not mean and there are some rules. We think they rule, so check 'em out and be kind to each other."}]}, "Silverbugs": {"time_collected": "2023-03-07 02:06:13.368281-05:00", "top_headers": [{"heading": "Did a count of the treasure box tonight.
