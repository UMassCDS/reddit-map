We understand certain doctrinal truths, which God uses as the instrument of our faith in Christ upon hearing the Word, to be essential for conversion, reconciliation to God, and deliverance from God\u2019s justice. They summarize what we must believe in order to be a Christian.\nThe gospel is the good news that, though we have all rebelled against the God who created us, God planned a way to show mercy when we deserved judgment. The Father sent His Son Jesus, who went willingly, who Himself shared God\u2019s very nature, into our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, taking on human flesh in order to share our nature. Jesus Christ, lived the life of obedience that the Father demanded of us but that we could not live, and He died the death that the Father required of us as sinners, though He Himself was without sin. Jesus\u2019 death satisfied God\u2019s justice for all those who turn in faith from idolatrous rebellion to worship Him alone.\nBeing freely and completely justified by grace through faith alone, by the righteousness of Christ, alien to our own, His people, being wholly part of the invisible Bride which He bought by His own blood, are completely and fully united to Him by His death, and will never fall away by the power of the Spirit who is the seal and guarantee of our future complete redemption.\nHis resurrection declares the Father\u2019s acceptance of his sacrifice and our hope of resurrection as well. God\u2019s grace offers eternal life in his presence to all who receive this work of Jesus Christ by confessing Him as Lord.\nThis is the one gospel; this is Christianity.
