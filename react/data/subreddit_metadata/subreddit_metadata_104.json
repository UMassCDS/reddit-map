Supported by decentralized attestation providers, the State Connector is both faster and safer than any existing solutions.\nCapture Price with the Flare Time Series Oracle\nMany decentralized systems still rely on centralized data feeds - this bakes in centralization to the systems using them. The FTSO leverages the distributed nature of the network to provide rapidly updating, accurate decentralized price data, such as the live XRP/USD price, to applications on the network.\nFAssets\nTwo-thirds of the value of all blockchains is currently held in non-smart contract chains which cannot participate in dApps, DeFi, NFTs and more. With FAssets, Flare will bring smart contracts to connected chains, unlocking this value, and welcoming these communities into the decentralized economy.\nLayerCake\nLayerCake is a secure and scalable cross-chain protocol that solves some of the biggest problems inherent in bridging. It leverages Flare to safely and trustlessly bridge assets between any two smart contract L1s. LayerCake also enables FAssets to flow to any other smart contract chain.\nBuild truly interoperable dApps\nState, price and information relay allows dApps to be built that coordinate users\u2019 actions across any set of connected chains.
