By empowering the users, we will transform the internet on a global scale.\nBlockchain-based smart contracts:\nIn the new internet era, the legislative power will be transferred from an opaque centralized authority to transparent codes. Rules and platforms will be entirely transparent and based on faithfully executed smart contracts.\nDigital Assets Issued by Anyone:\nBlockchain technology allows every individual the ability to issue digital assets under the protection of a decentralized internet. Digital assets allow strangers to collaborate and profit on a grand scale, which is the foundation of a prosperous decentralized internet.\nTron is a representative of the Web 4.0 Ecosystem. More than 100,000 users from more than 100 countries have become part of this network with ever expanding boundaries.\nTRON Protocol and the TVM allow anyone to develop DAPPs for themselves or their communities, with smart contracts making decentralized crowdfunding and token issuance easier than ever.
