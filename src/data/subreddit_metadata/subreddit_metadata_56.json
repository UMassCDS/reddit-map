For previous discussion on this topic, checkout this thread or this thread.\n2) How do I find a reputable Shiba breeder? The National Shiba Club of America maintains a listing of reputable Shiba breeders across the US. If you love dogs, please do not buy from a puppy mill or a backyard breeder.\n3) My shiba doesn't seem to eat when I put food out, are they okay? While loss of appetite can be indicative of a problem, some shibas like to nibble throughout the day instead of eating in one sitting. If you have this type of shiba, leave food out at all times, they will eat when they want. However, monitor their weight and adjust accordingly if they begin to eat too much. This behavior is also common when shibas are in a new environment or separated from their primary caretaker(s).\n4) My shiba spends a lot of time licking/grooming themselves, is this normal? While over-grooming may be indicative of allergies or other skin problems, shibas can spend a lot of time cleaning and manicuring themselves. This behavior is normal. Neurotic licking and biting to the point of hair-loss or scabbing is not normal and should be referred to a veterinarian.\n5) Why does my shiba take a long time to defecate on walks? Shibas often will not \"go\" near their home. The farther they are from home, the more likely they will. Sometimes they will have a common area that's used with frequency, once you've identified that area take them there.\n6) If you're the caretaker of a new shiba and you're looking for advice, please use the search feature. This question is asked all the time, there is a wealth of information going back many years. You will receive the greatest amount of advice with a simple search. Feel free to ask anyway, but historically these questions are ignored by the majority of our community due to their frequency.\n7) My shiba seems sick and/or their health seems different, what should I do? Veterinarians spend many years of their lives training to become experts so they can help in these situations - go see one! Even if a vet did respond, without seeing the dog in person a diagnosis will be lacking at best. This community is not meant for medical advice, any advice you receive is likely going to be poor, misleading, or blatantly wrong.\n8) I would like socialize and train my shiba, where can I learn? Visit /r/Dogtraining, they can get you started, give you tips for specific behaviors, and recommend other sources to develop these skills.\nLove dogs?

This one might need a NSFW tag sometimes. o_O\nLucid Request - For requests to make meme dreams. Did you see a meme in your dream but have no idea how to make it out of pixels and upload it? Well make a text post with this flair, and maybe some nice person will make it for you!
